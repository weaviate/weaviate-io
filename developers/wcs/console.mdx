The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) query application (query app) is a browser-based GraphQL IDE. Use the query app to work interactively with your WCD clusters.

![WCD query app](./img/wcs-console-example-query.png)

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql) is built into the query app. GraphiQL provides many features that make GraphQL easier to use interactively:

- Syntax highlighting
- Intelligent type ahead
- Automatic completion for queries and variables
- Real-time error highlighting and reporting for queries and variables


## Open the query app

To open the query app, connect to your WCD [WCD Dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud).

In the left-hand menu, click the Query app icon.

## Select a Weaviate instance

The query app connects directly to your WCD clusters. The query app can also connect to other Weaviate instances if you have the proper authorization credentials.

### Connect to a WCD cluster


In this example, the WCD Dashboard is connected to an external instance as well as the two WCD instances.

The GraphQL console can be used to query any of the three instances.

Click the `Query` button for a cluster to open a console window connected to that cluster.

Alternatively, the query window includes a drop-down menu at the top of the screen which can be used to choose the desired instance.

### Authentication

The query app connects to WCD instances, sandboxes and managed clusters,without any additional authentication details.

### Pass inference keys

To pass API keys for inference modules such as `text2vec-cohere`, `text2vec-cohere`, or `text2vec-openai`, use request headers. The `Header` tab is at bottom of the query screen. Add the service inference key to the query headers.

In this example, the `X-OpenAI-Api-Key` header sets the OpenAI API key.

The header can pass multiple keys.
