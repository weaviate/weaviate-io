Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS) is a fully managed, AI-native vector database in the cloud.

WCS manages the infrastructure so you can focus on innovation and build AI applications more easily. Use WCS to simplify development and confidently deploy enterprise-ready applications.

This site documents WCS specific features. You can find out more about the core database, client APIs, third-party modules, and other generally available Weaviate features on [the main documentation site](../weaviate/index.md).  


### Configuration

WCS instances of Weaviate come pre-configured as shown below to reduce the work and time required for you to get up and running.

:::info <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> How are WCS instances configured?
Each WCS instance is:

- Automatically created with the latest available version of Weaviate.
- Upgradeable to later versions of Weaviate as they are released.
- Pre-configured with a set of modules (see the [WCS dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud) for the relevant list for your instance).
  - Not configured with a default vectorizer. So you must [specify a vectorizer in the schema](../weaviate/manage-data/collections.mdx#specify-a-vectorizer) if you want Weaviate to vectorize your data.
- Configured with authentication for security (optional for the sandbox).
  - We recommend using a Weaviate client for the most convenient experience with authentication.
- Accessible through the Weaviate Console.

<details>
  <summary>Is it possible to modify WCS instances' configurations?</summary>

For the moment, all WCS instances are pre-configured and are not able to be changed by the user, although this is planned for the future.

If you require a particular module or configuration that is different to one used by WCS instances, please [reach out to us](https://console.weaviate.cloud/contact) to have a chat about custom deployments.

Alternatively you can also try a self-deployment option with [Docker](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

### WCS vs Weaviate open-source

Weaviate offers the same capabilities regardless of whether you run Weaviate as a self-deployed solution, or through WCS.

The difference is in how they are configured, hosted and deployed, and who manages them.
