## About WCS

### What is WCS?

WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services, is a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution for providing managed Weaviate instances.

Through WCS, we aim provide you with the most convenient experience possible with Weaviate. We do this by reflecting in WCS the best practices for running Weaviate on the cloud, and managing the underlying infrastructure so you can focus on using Weaviate to add value to your work.

### Capabilities

Because configuring the open-source instance of Weaviate can be challenging for many, WCS instances of Weaviate come pre-configured. This is designed to reduce the work and time required for you to get up and running.

:::info <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> How are WCS instances configured?
Each WCS instance is:
- Automatically created with the latest available version of Weaviate.
- Upgradeable to later versions of Weaviate as they are released.
- Pre-configured with the `text2vec-cohere`, `text2vec-huggingface`, `text2vec-openai`, `qna-openai` and `generative-openai` modules.
- Configured with authentication for security (optional for the sandbox).
    - We recommend using a Weaviate client library for the most convenient experience with authentication.
- Accessible through the Weaviate Console.

<details>
  <summary>Is it possible to modify WCS instances' configurations?</summary>

For the moment, all WCS instances are pre-configured and are not able to be changed by the user, although this is planned for the future.

If you require a particular module or configuration that is different to one used by WCS instances, please [reach out to us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/weaviate/shared_invite/zt-goaoifjr-o8FuVz9b1HLzhlUfyfddhw) to have a chat, or try a self-deployment option with [Docker](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

### WCS vs Weaviate open-source

The Weaviate "core" software library is the same regardless of whether you run Weaviate as a self-deployed solution, or through WCS.

The difference is in how they are configured, hosted and deployed, and who manages them.
