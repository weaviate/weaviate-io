## Frequently asked questions

### Accounts

Q: Can I reset or change my account password?
A: Yes, you can do so on the WCS login page by clicking "Forgot Password".

### Instance management

Q: Are WCS clusters backed up?
A: We do automated daily backups, and additionally whenever a Weaviate version is updated on the cluster.

Q: Can WCS clusters be updated to newer versions of Weaviate?
A: Yes. Once a new version is enabled on WCS, you will see a button next to the Weaviate version display on the cluster details to trigger the update.

Q: Are WCS clusters' resources automatically scaled?
A: Not currently. At the moment, we provision each instance for “most common” usage scenarios.

Q: What do I do if I prefer a heavier-load WCS instance?
A: If you feel that your use case requires a customized hardware provisioning, please reach out to us first. We can then work with you to evaluate and potentially create a managed cluster.

### Infrastructure

Q: What infrastructure does WCS run on?
A: Currently it runs on GCP, with plans to add AWS and Azure in the near future.

### Others

Q: Why can't I see my old WCS sandbox?
A: If you created a sandbox on our legacy system at `console.weaviate.io`, it will be visible [through here](https://console.weaviate.io/) but not on the new system.

Q: Does the WCS console collect data from users?
A: The console never collects any data from your Weaviate instance; you can safely connect every instance, also over VPN.
