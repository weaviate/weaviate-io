Frequently asked questions (FAQs) for WCS.

## Accounts
### Can I reset or change my account password?

Yes. Go the [WCS login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and click the "Log in" button. Then, click "Forgot Password". Enter your email address on the next screen. WCS sends a reset email to the address you enter.

### Where is my verification email?

If you do not receive a verification email, check your spam folder. If you still cannot find it, follow the steps to [reset you password](./faq.mdx#can-i-reset-or-change-my-account-password) to get a new letter.

## Instance management
### Are WCS clusters backed up?

Yes. WCS has automated, daily backups. WCS also backs up your data before updating the version of Weaviate running on your cluster.

### Can WCS clusters be updated to newer versions of Weaviate?

Yes. Click the "Details" button for your cluster. If a new version is available, click the "Update!" button when you have a suitable maintenance window. The button is only visible when there is a newer version available. 

### Are cluster resources scaled automatically?

Not currently. Clusters are provisioned for common usage scenarios. WCS monitors each instance to determine when a cluster needs to be resized.

### Can I request more cluster resources?

Possibly. If you want to customize your cluster provisioning, contact our support team at [support@weaviate.io](mailto:support@weaviate.io) to discuss possible solutions.

## Infrastructure

### What infrastructure does WCS run on?

WCS runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Amazon Web services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are on our roadmap.

## WCS Console

### Does the WCS console collect data from users?

The WCS console doesn't collect any data from your Weaviate instance. However, WCS does monitor your instances and collect operational data in order to manage them. 

### Can the WCS console connect to non-WCS instances?

Yes. The Weaviate GraphQL query app can connect to Weaviate instances outside WCS.
