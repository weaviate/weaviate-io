Frequently asked questions (FAQs) about [Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).

## Account management
#### Q: Can I reset or change my account password?

Yes. Go the [Weaviate Cloud login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and click the "Log in" button. Then, click "Forgot Password". Enter your email address on the next screen. Weaviate Cloud sends a reset email to the address you enter.

#### Q: Where is my verification email?

If you do not receive a verification email, check your spam folder. If you still cannot find it, follow the steps to [reset your password](./faq.mdx#can-i-reset-or-change-my-account-password) to get a new letter.

## Instance management
#### Q: Are Weaviate Cloud clusters backed up?

Yes. Weaviate Cloud has automated daily backups. Weaviate Cloud also backs up your data before updating the version of Weaviate running on your cluster.

#### Q: Can Weaviate Cloud clusters be updated to newer versions of Weaviate?

Yes. Click the "Details" button for your cluster. If a new version is available, click the "Update!" button when you have a suitable maintenance window. The button is only visible when there is a newer version available.

#### Q: Are cluster resources scaled automatically?

Not currently. Clusters are provisioned for common usage scenarios. Weaviate Cloud monitors each instance to determine when a cluster needs to be resized.

#### Q: Can I request more cluster resources?

Possibly. If you want to customize your cluster provisioning, contact our support team at [support@weaviate.io](mailto:support@weaviate.io) to discuss possible solutions.

#### Q: How many clusters can I have at the same time?

By default, an organization can have up to six (6) serverless clusters and two (2) sandbox clusters at the same time. To change these limits, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## Infrastructure

#### Q: What infrastructure does Weaviate Cloud run on?

Weaviate Cloud runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are on our roadmap.

## Weaviate Cloud Console

#### Q: Does the Weaviate Cloud console collect data from users?

The Weaviate Cloud console doesn't collect any data from your Weaviate instance. However, Weaviate Cloud does monitor your instances and collect operational data in order to manage them.

#### Q: Can the Weaviate Cloud console connect to non-Weaviate Cloud instances?

Yes. The Weaviate GraphQL query tool can connect to Weaviate instances outside of Weaviate Cloud.
