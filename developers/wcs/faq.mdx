## Frequently asked questions

### Accounts

#### Q: Can I reset or change my account password?

> Yes, you can do so on the WCS login page by clicking "Forgot Password".

### Sandbox

#### Q: When will my sandbox expire?

> Currently, it will expire in 14 days.

#### Q: How can I preserve my sandbox data?

> If you would like to preserve your sandbox data, you can retrieve your data with our [cursor API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects#exhaustive-listing-using-a-cursor-after), or [contact us to upgrade](/pricing#register) to a production SaaS instance.

#### Q: How many objects can I have in a sandbox instance?

> There is no hard limit on the sandbox database size, but its performance may be limited for larger workloads (e.g. millions of objects) due to the provisioned resources.

### Instance management

#### Q: Are WCS clusters backed up?

> We do automated daily backups, and additionally whenever a Weaviate version is updated on the cluster.

#### Q: Can WCS clusters be updated to newer versions of Weaviate?

> Yes. Once a new version is enabled on WCS, you will see a button next to the Weaviate version display on the cluster details to trigger the update.

#### Q: Are WCS clusters' resources automatically scaled?

> Not currently. At the moment, we provision each instance for “most common” usage scenarios.

#### Q: What do I do if I prefer a heavier-load WCS instance?

> If you feel that your use case requires a customized hardware provisioning, please reach out to us first. We can then work with you to evaluate and potentially create a managed cluster.

### Infrastructure

#### Q: What infrastructure does WCS run on?

> Currently it runs on GCP, with plans to add AWS and Azure in the near future.

### Console

#### Q: Does the WCS console collect data from users?

> The console never collects any data from your Weaviate instance; you can safely connect every instance, also over VPN.

#### Q: Can the WCS console connect to non-WCS instances?

> Yes, the WCS console can connect to a Weaviate instance regardless of whether it is a WCS instance or not.

### Others

#### Q: Why can't I see my old WCS sandbox?

> If you created a sandbox on our legacy system at `console.weaviate.io`, it will be visible [through here](https://console.weaviate.io/) but not on the new WCS (at [https://console.weaviate.cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)).
