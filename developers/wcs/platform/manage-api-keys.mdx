By default, API keys are enabled for all WCD clusters.

There are two types of API key, `ReadOnly` and `Admin`.

- `Admin` keys are read-write.
- `ReadOnly` keys do not grant write access to the database.

Serverless clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key.

Sandbox clusters have an administrator key.

If you have a Serverless cluster, you can create and delete API keys.


## Create an API key

If you have a Serverless cluster, you can create new API keys. New API keys are not available in Sandbox clusters.

WCS restarts the cluster when you add a new API key. If you have a stand-alone cluster, you will have a short downtime while the cluster restarts. There is no downtime if you have a high availability cluster.

To create a new API key, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button.
1. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Click `Add Key`.

4. Choose the key scope, read-only or admin.
1. Click `Generate` to create the key.

## Delete an API key

If you have a Serverless cluster, you can delete API keys.

WCD restarts the cluster when you delete an API key. If you have a stand-alone cluster, you will have a short downtime while the cluster restarts. There is no downtime if you have a high availability cluster.

To delete an API key, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button.
1. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Click the trash-can icon to delete the API key.

1. Open the WCD console and find the panel for your cluster.
1. Click the `Details` button.
