## Update the server version

 WCS restarts your cluster during an upgrade. To avoid downtime, consider using high availability (HA) clusters for production workloads. A standard cluster is unavailable during upgrade. An HA cluster upgrades one node at a time so the cluster is available during the update.

 To update a cluster, follow these steps:
 
 1. Click the "Upgrade!" button on the cluster details tile.
 1. Enter your cluster name in the text entry box.
 1. Click confirm.

During the update, the console displays a status indicator.

The indicator goes way when the cluster is ready.
