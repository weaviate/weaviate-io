## Pricing

Serverless clusters are billed monthly. The monthly charge for a cluster depends on resource usage. Your support plan is a factor in the monthly cost, but you are not charged per support incident.

Each support plan has a billing rate. Weaviate Cloud counts the objects in your cluster and multiples that number by the rate for your support plan. Weaviate Cloud adjusts the number if compression is enabled. The result is your usage charge.

If you have a high availability cluster (HA), Weaviate Cloud multiples the usage charge by three to account for the additional resources.

There is a minimum monthly charge at each support plan. If your usage charge is less than the monthly minimum, Weaviate charges you the monthly minimum cost. If your usage charge is higher than the minimum value for your plan, Weaviate charges you for your cluster usage.

To estimate costs for different combinations of usage levels and support plans, see the [pricing calculator](https://weaviate.io/services/serverless).
