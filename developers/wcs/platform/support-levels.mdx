## Pricing

Support costs are billed monthly. There is a minimum price for each support level. The actual cost per month depends on your data. 

Support costs are based on resource usage. Each day, WCS counts the objects in your cluster and multiples the number of objects by the number of dimensions per object. This value is called the `vector dimension`. The vector dimension is the basis of the price calculation.

Compression saves resources and lowers the vector dimension number. If you enable compression, the cost savings are significant.

Each support level (SLA) has a billing rate per one million vector dimensions. After WCS determines the number of vector dimensions in your cluster, WCS multiples that number by the SLA rate. The result is your usage charge. 

If you have a high availability cluster (HA), WCS multiples the usage charge by three to account for the additional resources. 

If your usage charge is less than the minimum monthly charge for your SLA, you are charged the monthly minimum. If your usage charge is higher than the minimum value, you are charged for your usage. 

To estimate costs at different usage levels, see the [pricing calculator](https://weaviate.io/services/serverless).
