Sandbox clusters are free. You do not need a billing account to create a Sandbox cluster.

Serverless clusters are charged for resource usage. The monthly charge is determined by your usage and your support level. You have to have a billing account to create a serverless cluster.

To estimate costs for different combinations of usage levels and SLAs, see the [pricing calculator](https://weaviate.io/services/serverless).

## Create an account

Weaviate Cloud (WCD) uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for billing. To create a Stripe account, follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li>Open the organization dropdown menu.</li>
  <li>
    Click on the <code>Organization settings</code> button.
  </li>
</ol>

import OrganizationSettings from '/developers/wcs/img/weaviate-cloud-organization-settings.png';

<div class="row">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card__image">
      <img src={OrganizationSettings} alt="Explorer Tool" />
    </div>
    <div class="card__body">
      <p>
        Open the organization dropdown menu (<span class="callout">1</span>) and
        click on <code>Organization settings</code> (
        <span class="callout">2</span>).
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

import BillingSection from '/developers/wcs/img/weaviate-cloud-billing-section.png';

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Under the <code>Billing</code> section, click on the 
    <code>Add payment method</code> button.
  </li>
  <li>Fill in the needed personal information.</li>
  <li>Create your Stripe account.</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card__image">
      <img src={BillingSection} alt="Explorer Tool" />
    </div>
    <div class="card__body">
      <p>
        Click on the <code>Add payment method</code> (
        <span class="callout">3</span>) button.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Usage charges

Usage charges reflect the number and size of the objects in your collection. Weaviate polls each collection to determine a daily object count.

- If the objects are uncompressed, the billing system multiplies the object count by the number of dimensions to get the `vectorDimensionsSum`.
- If the objects are compressed, the billing system multiplies the object count by the number of vector segments to get the `vectorSegmentsSum`.

The values are added together and normalized to get a base price. The base price is multiplied by the pricing rate for the cluster's SLA tier.

If the cluster has **high availability**, the pricing rate is multiplied by three.

Significant cost savings can be achieved when **compression** is enabled.

## Support levels

Weaviate offers three levels of support, [Standard](/developers/wcs/platform/support-levels#standard-support), [Professional](/developers/wcs/platform/support-levels#professional-support), and [Business Critical](/developers/wcs/platform/support-levels#business-critical-support). Each support level (SLA) has a billing rate for usage and a minimum cost per month.

- If the usage cost is less than the monthly minimum charge for the SLA, Weaviate bills the monthly minimum.
- If the usage cost exceeds the monthly minimum, Weaviate bills the minimum amount plus any additional charges.

## High availability

If you have a high availability (HA) cluster, Weaviate Cloud multiples the minimum charge and the usage charges by three to account for the additional resources.

## Billing cycles

Billing runs on 30-day cycles. Charges are calculated for active clusters every 30 days; the billing periods are not aligned with calendar months.
