Weaviate Cloud (WCD) uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for billing.

## Exact and Mollie

Older accounts may receive invoices from [Exact](https://www.exact.com/) or [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/). Exact and Mollie are deprecated. Accounts that still use these services are being updated to use Stripe.
