## Pricing

Support costs are billed monthly. There is a minimum price for each support level, but the actual cost per month depends on the size of your database. 

Costs are based on resource usage. Each day, WCS counts the objects in your cluster and determines how many dimensions they have. This value is called the `vector dimension`. The vector dimension is the basis of the price calculation.

Compression saves resources and lowers the vector dimension number. If you enable compression, the cost savings are significant.

Each SLA has a rate per one million vector dimensions. After WCS determines the number of vector dimensions in your cluster, it multiples that number by the SLA rate. The result is your usage charge. 

If you have a high availability cluster (HA), WCS multiples the usage charge by three to account for the additional resources. 

If your usage charge is less than the minimum monthly charge for your SLA, you are charged the monthly minimum. If your usage charge is higher than the minimum value, you ar charged for your usage. 

To estimate costs at different usage levels, see the [pricing calculator](https://weaviate.io/services/serverless).
