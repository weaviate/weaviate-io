[Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) hosts clusters that run the Weaviate core database server. WCS runs the current production version of Weaviate core. 

## New clusters


## Upgrade

## Additional considerations

- **Billing**. If your cluster's Weaviate core version cannot support the billing requirements for your pricing plan, WCS upgrades your cluster to the current production version or the most recent compatible version. 
- **Data integrity**. If your cluster's Weaviate core version has a known risk of data loss or corruption, WCS upgrades the cluster when a fix is released.
- **Downgrade**. You cannot downgrade your WCS cluster to an earlier version of Weaviate core.
- **Enterprise customers**. If you are an enterprise customer and you require a specific version of Weaviate core, contact your support representative. In some circumstances, WCS can install a specific Weaviate core version.
