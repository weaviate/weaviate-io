Multi-factor authentication (MFA) increases the security of browser logins. MFA is not enabled by default.

## Enable multi-factor authentication

To enable MFA, follow these steps.

1. Use your browser to connect to the WCD console.
1. Click on your account profile. Select Account settings.
3. Click the 'Manage Two-Factor Authentication' button.
1. Enter your password to re-authenticate to WCD.
1. Open your authenticator application and scan the QR code.
1. Enter the code from your application in WCD.

After you configure MFA, WCD prompts you to supply the one-time authentication code each time you log in.

## Disable MFA

To disable MFA, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## MFA and applications

If you use a JavaScript or TypeScript client to connect a browser hosted application to Weaviate, do not enable MFA for that client's account.

There is no way to pass the the one-time authentication code to the application, so the application cannot connect to WCD.

Use API keys to connect browser based client applications to WCD.
