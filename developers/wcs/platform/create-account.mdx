## Configure billing information

Sandbox instances are free, short term instances that expire after 14 days. If you are using a Sandbox instance to try Weaviate, you don't have to set up billing.

Serverless clusters are persistent instances that are suitable for production, development, and testing. Serverless clusters are paid instances. The cost of each instance depends on the instance type and the support level you choose. You must configure billing before you can create a serverless instance.
