Accounts in Weaviate Cloud (WCD) are based on organizations. There is an organization for each user account. Users can belong to more than one organization.

## User accounts

User accounts are identified by email addresses. Each user account has it's own default [organization](#organizations).

- To create a user account, follow [these steps](/developers/wcs/platform/create-account).
- To delete a user account, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## Organizations

Organizations group user accounts together. Every user in the organization has the same access to organization assets:

- Cluster management
- User management
- Organization management
- Billing configuration

Be cautious when you add users to your organization, especially in production. Each user in an organization has full access to the modify the organization and its clusters.

## Edit organization settings

User editable configuration settings are on the organization settings tab.

To open the settings tab, click `Organization settings` at the bottom of the organizations pull down menu.

## Manage users

Any member of an organization can add or remove a user. A new user has to have a WCD account.

### Add a user

A WCD user can be a member of more than one organization. Once a user creates an account in WCD, you can add that user to your organization.

To add a user, follow these steps:

1. Ask the user for WCD account details.

   - If the user has an account, note the email address.
   - If the user does not have an account, [create a new account](/developers/wcs/platform/create-account).

2. Open the [organization settings](#edit-organization-settings) panel.
1. Enter the user's email address in the `Users` section. Click `Add user`.

WCD sends an email to the user when the user is added to the organization.

### Remove a user

To remove a user, follow these steps:

1. Open the [organization settings](#edit-organization-settings) panel.
1. Find the user's email address in the `Users` section.
1. Click the trashcan icon to delete the user.
1. Click `Confirm`.

If you have clusters that are created by the deleted user, those clusters are still available after the restart.

## Billing

[Billing](/developers/wcs/platform/billing.mdx) is done on an organization level.

Once a billing account is configured, every user in an organization can create new clusters or modify existing ones.

The account gets an invoice for each cluster. Cluster invoices are sent every 30 days, starting from when the cluster is created.
