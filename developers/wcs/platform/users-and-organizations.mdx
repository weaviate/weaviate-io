Accounts in Weaviate Cloud (WCD) are based on organizations. There is an organization for each user account. Users can belong to more than one organization.

## User accounts

User accounts are identified by email addresses. Each user account has its own default [organization](#organizations).

- To create a user account, follow [these steps](/developers/wcs/platform/create-account).
- To delete a user account, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## Organizations

Organizations group user accounts together. Every user in the organization has the same access to organization assets:

- Cluster management
- User management
- Organization management
- Billing configuration

Be cautious when you add users to your organization, especially in production. Each user in an organization has full access to the modify the organization and its clusters.

## Manage user accounts

Any member of an organization can add or remove a user. A new user has to have a Weaviate Cloud account.

### Add a user

A Weaviate Cloud user can be a member of more than one organization. Even if a user doesn't have an account in Weaviate Cloud, you can add that user to your organization, and they can create the account afterward.

To add a user, follow these steps:

1. Ask the user for the email address used in their Weaviate Cloud account.
2. Open the [Organization settings](#organization-settings) page.
3. Enter the user's email address in the `Users` section. Click `Add user`.

Weaviate Cloud sends an email to the user when the user is added to the organization.

### Remove a user

To remove a user, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Organization settings](#organization-settings) page.
1. Find the user's email address in the `Users` section.
1. Click the trashcan icon to delete the user.
1. Click `Confirm`.

If you have clusters that are created by the deleted user, those clusters are still available after the restart.

## Billing

[Billing](/developers/wcs/platform/billing.mdx) is done on an organization level.

Once a billing account is configured, every user in an organization can create new clusters or modify existing ones.

The account gets an invoice for each cluster. Cluster invoices are sent every 30 days, starting from when the cluster is created.
