Accounts in Weaviate Cloud Services (WCD) are based on organizations. There is an organization for each user account. Users can belong to more than one organization.

## User accounts

User accounts are identified by email addresses. Each account has it's own [organization](#organizations).

- To create an account, follow [these steps](/developers/wcs/create-account).
- To delete an account, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## Organizations

Organizations group user accounts. Every user in the organization has the same access to organization assets:

- Cluster management
- Billing configuration
- User management

Be cautious when you add users to your organization, especially in production, since each user has full access to the organization.

### Edit organization settings

User editable configuration settings are on the Organization settings tab.

To open the settings tab, click `Organization settings` at the bottom of the organizations pull down menu.

### Create an organization

To create a new organization, follow these steps:

1. Click the Organizations pulldown menu in the WCD console.

    <img src={OrgPulldown} width="75%" alt="Organization pulldown menu"/>

2. Click "Add new organization".
1. Enter the organization name.

WCD automatically switches to the new organization.

### Invite users

A WCD user can be a member of more than one organization. Once a user creates an account, you can add that user to your organization.

To add a user, follow these steps:

1. Ask the user for WCD account details.

   - If the user has an account, note the email address.
   - If the user does not have an account, [create a new account](/developers/wcs/create-account).

2. Open the [Organization settings](#edit-organization-settings) panel.
1. Enter the user's email address in the `Users` section. Click `Add user`.

WCD sends an email to the user when the user is added to the organization.

### Remove users

To remove users, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Organization settings](#edit-organization-settings) panel.
1. Find the user's email address in the `Users` section.
1. Click the trashcan icon to delete the user.
1. Click `Confirm`.

<RestartTheCluster/>

If you have clusters created by the deleted user, those clusters are still available after the restart.

### Delete organization

To delete an organization, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## Billing

[Billing](/developers/wcs/platform/billing.mdx) is done on an organization level.

Once a billing account is configured, every user in an organization can create new clusters or modify existing ones.

Each cycle the account gets a bill that includes charges for all of the clusters. The charges are itemized by cluster, not by user.
