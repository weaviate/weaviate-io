I am evaluating Weaviate for my company and currently using a sandbox to evaluate it, 

You can use PQ in sandbox. Sandbox is in fact the very same version you have in a paid cluster and the very same you get from docker or binary. It only has limited resources (memory, cpu, storage), so donâ€™t expect too much from it :grimacing: Regarding bit_compression, its no longer used and 


The free sandbox will only have a limited amount of allocated memory and disk space, and it will not scale after that. While the paid plans have more resources and will be scaled as needed.

Hi! In WCS you can only use vectorization services, like openAI, cohere and all the ones listed in your cluster dashboard.


Hi @Hawajka :wave:, Currently only paid accounts have access to read-only API keys and the ability to add more keys if needed, free sandbox accounts only have one admin key that should be visible in the WCS console.

There is no limit on the number of objects. However, sandbox performance may be limited for larger workloads.
