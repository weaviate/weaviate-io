## Sandboxes

### When do sandboxes expire?

Sandboxes expire in 14 days.

### How can I save my sandbox data?

To retrieve a copy of your sandbox data, use the [cursor API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects#exhaustive-listing-using-a-cursor-after).

To preserve your data and upgrade to a paid instance, [contact us](mailto:support@weaviate.io) for help.

### How many objects can a sandbox hold?

There is no limit on the number of objects. However, sandbox performance may be limited for larger workloads.
