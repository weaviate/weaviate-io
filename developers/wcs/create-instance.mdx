## Create a cluster

To create a cluster, click the 'Create cluster' button on the WCS Dashboard page.

Follow the steps to create a cluster:

- [Sandbox clusters](#sandbox-clusters)
- [Managed clusters](#managed-clusters).

### Sandbox clusters

To create a sandbox cluster, follow these steps:

import CreateSandboxCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-sandbox.mdx'

<CreateSandboxCluster />

### Managed clusters

Managed clusters require billing details. WCS prompts you to add billing details if you have not already added them.

To create a managed cluster, follow these steps:

import CreateManagedCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-managed.mdx'

<CreateManagedCluster />

## Authentication

By default, API keys are enabled for all WCS clusters. Managed clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key. Sandbox clusters only have an administrator key.

When you develop your client application, use an API key to connect your client to the cluster. For more details, see [authentication](./authentication.mdx).

To get API keys, click the `API keys` button.

## Weaviate core version

When you provision a new cluster, WCS uses the current version of Weaviate core to set up the new cluster. There may be a short delay between the release of a new Weaviate core version and its availability in WCS.  

WCS does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate core is released. 

For more details on WCS versioning, see [Cluster server version](/developers/wcs/platform/version).
