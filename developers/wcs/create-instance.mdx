## Create a cluster

To create a cluster, click the 'Create cluster' button on the WCD Dashboard page.

![Create a cluster](./img/wcs-console-no-clusters.jpg)

Follow the steps to create a cluster:

- [Sandbox clusters](#sandbox-clusters)
- [Serverless clusters](#serverless-clusters).

### Sandbox clusters

To create a sandbox cluster, follow these steps:

import CreateSandboxCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-sandbox.mdx'

<CreateSandboxCluster />

### Serverless clusters

Serverless clusters require billing details. WCD prompts you to add billing details if you have not already added them.

To create a serverless cluster, follow these steps:

import CreateServerlessCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-managed.mdx'

<CreateServerlessCluster />

## Authentication

By default, API keys are enabled for all WCD clusters. Serverless clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key. Sandbox clusters only have an administrator key.

When you develop your client application, use an API key to connect your client to the cluster. For more details, see [authentication](/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication).

To get API keys, click the `API keys` button.

## Weaviate core version

import V125EarlyAccess from '/_includes/wcs/version-1-25-early-access.mdx';

<V125EarlyAccess />

When you provision a new cluster, WCD uses the current version of Weaviate core to set up the new cluster. There may be a short delay between the release of a new Weaviate core version and its availability in WCD.

WCD does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate core is released.

For more details on WCD versioning, see [Cluster server version](/developers/wcs/platform/version).

## Number of clusters

By default, an organization can have up to six serverless clusters and two sandbox clusters at the same time. To change these limits, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).
