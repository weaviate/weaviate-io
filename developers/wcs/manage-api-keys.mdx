By default, API keys are enabled for all WCD clusters.

- Serverless clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key.
- Sandbox clusters have an administrator key.

## Manage API keys

If you have a Serverless cluster, you can create and delete API keys.

There are two types of API key, `ReadOnly` and `Admin`.

- `Admin` keys are read-write.
- `ReadOnly` keys do not grant write access to the database.

### Create an API key

If you have a Serverless cluster, you can create new API keys. New API keys are not available in Sandbox clusters.

WCS restarts the cluster when you add a new API key. If you have a stand-alone cluster, you will have a short downtime while the cluster restarts. There is no downtime if you have a high availability cluster.

To create a new API key, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button.
1. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Click `Add Key`.

4. Choose the key scope, read-only or admin.
1. Click `Generate` to create the key.

### Delete an API key

If you have a Serverless cluster, you can delete API keys.

WCD restarts the cluster when you delete an API key. If you have a stand-alone cluster, you will have a short downtime while the cluster restarts. There is no downtime if you have a high availability cluster.

To delete an API key, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button.
1. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Click the trash-can icon to delete the API key.

## Retrieve your API keys

To retrieve your API keys, follow these steps:

1. Open the WCD console and find the panel for your cluster.
1. Click the `Details` button.

3. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Copy the key and store it in a safe location.


## Authenticate a client application

The Weaviate server authenticates every request.

If you use a tool like cURL, add your API key to the request header.

If you use a Weaviate client library, pass the API key when you instantiate the client connection. After the connection is established, you do not have to pass the API key when you make requests.

Do not hard-code your API key in your client code. Consider passing the API key as an environment variable or using a similar secure coding technique.

```bash
export WEAVIATE_API_KEY="replaceThisPartWithYourAPIKey"
```

import WCDAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.api.key.mdx';

<WCDAuthenticationApiKey/>
