## Overview

Welcome to the **Quickstart guide** for Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). Here, you will learn:
- How to set up a Weaviate instance on WCS, and
- How to instantiate a Weaviate client to communicate with the WCS instance.

### Agenda

By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with the basics of WCS. You will have:
- Created a WCS account,
- Created a new free WCS sandbox instance without authentication,
- Installed a Weaviate client of your choice, and
- Queried your new WCS sandbox instance with the Weaviate client.

And if you wish, you will be ready to move onto our [Weaviate Quickstart tutorial](../weaviate/quickstart/index.md) next.

## Sign in to WCS

1. First, access WCS by navigating to the [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud), and click on "Sign in with the Weaviate Cloud Services".
    1. If you don't have an account with WCS yet, click on the "Register" button and create a new account.
1. Then, sign in with your WCS username and password.

## Create a Weaviate Cluster

To create a new Weaviate Cluster, click the "Create cluster" button.

Then:

1. Select the **Free sandbox** *plan tier*.
1. Provide a *cluster name*, which will become a part of its URL. A suffix will be added to this to ensure uniqueness.
1. Set the `Enable Authentication?` option to `NO`.

Your selections should look like this:

Finally, press **Create** to create your sandbox instance. Note that the sandbox will expire after a set number of days.

<img src={WCScreate} width="100%" alt="Create instance"/>

This will start the process to create a new instance, and you will see a progress indicator.

Instance creation should take a minute or two, and you will see a tick ✔️ when it's done, indicating that the instance is ready.

import SandBoxExpiry from '/_includes/sandbox.expiry.mdx';

In the meantime, let's start installing a client library.

## Install a client library

You can communicate with Weaviate using the available [client libraries](../weaviate/client-libraries/index.md) (currently for `Python`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Java` and `Go`), the [GraphQL API](../weaviate/api/graphql/index.md), or the [RESTful API](../weaviate/api/rest/index.md).

import ClientCapabilitiesOverview from '/_includes/client.capabilities.mdx'

<ClientCapabilitiesOverview />

Install your preferred client by following the relevant instructions below:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart.clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

## Connect to your WCS instance

By now, you should have:
* Set up a sandbox instance of Weaviate on WCS, and
* Installed a Weaviate client library.

Let's put the pieces together by connecting to the Weaviate instance and retrieving the existing schema, which should be empty.

This can be done by sending a request to the `schema` endpoint.

:::tip Authentication
If you have enabled authentication in your sandbox for added security, this step will require that you pass on the authentication credentials. Please see the [authentication guide](./guides/authentication.mdx) for how.
:::

Run the below code for your preferred client, replacing the endpoint address with your own:

:::tip Where to get the instance URL
You can get the URL for your WCS instance from the WCS dashboard, once you've logged in and the instance creation is complete. Click through to see the detail on your cluster, and you'll see the URL there.
:::

import WCSClientInstantiation from '/_includes/code/wcs.client.instantiation.mdx';

<WCSClientInstantiation/>

You should receive a response confirming the instance to be empty.

```json
{'classes': []}
```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a cloud-based vector database with WCS.

## Next

Now that you are set up with a WCS instance:
* If you are new to Weaviate at large, we recommend moving to the [Weaviate Quickstart Tutorial](../weaviate/quickstart/index.md).
* Otherwise, we hope you enjoy your experience with WCS.
