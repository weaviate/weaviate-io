## Overview

Welcome to the **Quickstart guide** for Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). Here, you will learn:
- How to set up a Weaviate instance on WCS, and
- How to instantiate a Weaviate client to communicate with the WCS instance.

### Agenda

By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with the basics of WCS. You will have:
- Created a WCS account,
- Created a new free WCS sandbox instance without authentication,
- Installed a Weaviate client of your choice, and
- Queried your new WCS sandbox instance with the Weaviate client.

And if you wish, you will be ready to move onto our [Weaviate Quickstart tutorial](../weaviate/quickstart/index.md) next.

## Sign in to WCS

1. First, go to the [WCS Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud), and click on "Sign in with the Weaviate Cloud Services".
    1. Click <kbd>Sign in with the Weaviate Cloud Services</kbd>.
    1. If you don't have a WCS account, click on <kbd>Register</kbd>.
1. Sign in with your WCS username and password.

## Create a Weaviate Cluster

To create a new Weaviate Cluster, click the <kbd>Create cluster</kbd> button.

Then:

1. Select the <kbd>Free sandbox</kbd> tier.
1. Provide a *Cluster name*. This will become a part of its URL, with a suffix added to ensure uniqueness.
1. Set *Enable Authentication?* to <kbd>YES</kbd>.

Click <kbd>Create</kbd>. This will take ~2 minutes and you'll see a tick ✔️ when finished.

This will start the process to create a new instance, and you will see a progress indicator.

Instance creation should take a minute or two, and you will see a tick ✔️ when it's done, indicating that the instance is ready.

#### Your cluster details

To access your cluster, you will need:
- The Weaviate URL, and
- Authentication details (Weaviate API key).

Click <kbd>Details</kbd> to see them.

For the Weaviate API key, click on the <kbd>API keys <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i></kbd> button.

import SandBoxExpiry from '/_includes/sandbox.expiry.mdx';

<SandBoxExpiry/>

In the meantime, let's start installing a client library.

## Install a client library

We suggest using a [Weaviate client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md). To install your preferred client <i class="fa-solid fa-down"></i>:

import ClientCapabilitiesOverview from '/_includes/client.capabilities.mdx'

<ClientCapabilitiesOverview />

Install your preferred client by following the relevant instructions below:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart/clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

## Connect to your WCS instance

By now, you should have:
* Set up a sandbox instance of Weaviate on WCS, and
* Installed a Weaviate client library.

From the <kbd>Details</kbd> tab in WCS, get:
- The Weaviate **API key**, and
- The Weaviate **URL**.

Replace the endpoint address and API key in the following code with your address and key, then run the code for your preferred client:

import WCSClientInstantiation from '/_includes/code/wcs.client.instantiation.mdx';

<WCSClientInstantiation/>

You should receive a response containing the current schema, confirming the server is ready.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a cloud-based vector database with WCS.

## Next

Now that you are set up with a WCS instance:
* If you are new to Weaviate at large, we recommend moving to the [Weaviate Quickstart Tutorial](../weaviate/quickstart/index.md).
* Otherwise, we hope you enjoy your experience with WCS.
