The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) Collections tool makes it easy for developers and non-technical users to create, manage, and delete collections.

Use the tool to precisely tune a new collection. Specify a vectorizer and an embedding model. Configure collection properties for faster searches and more accurate results.

## Select a cluster

The collections tool is available for collections that are hosted in Weaviate Cloud.

To begin, select the `Collections` tool from the left hand menu. After you select the collection tool, the `Clusters` panel lists the clusters that are available. Select a cluster from the list to create a new collection or to see the collections that are already in the cluster.

If you don't see any available clusters, select the `Clusters` option from the left hand menu and follow steps to [create a new cluster](/developers/wcs/create-instance).
