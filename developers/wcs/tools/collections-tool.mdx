The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) Collections tool makes it easy for developers and non-technical users to create, manage, and delete collections.

Use the tool to precisely tune a new collection. Specify a vectorizer and an embedding model. Configure collection properties for faster searches and more accurate results.

## Select a cluster

The collections tool is available for collections that are hosted in Weaviate Cloud.

To begin, select the `Collections` tool from the left hand menu. After you select the collection tool, the `Clusters` panel lists the clusters that are available. Select a cluster from the list to create a new collection or to see the collections that are already in the cluster.

If you don't see any available clusters, select the `Clusters` option from the left hand menu and follow steps to [create a new cluster](/developers/wcs/create-instance).

## Create a collection

The `Create collection` button opens the collection editor. Click the button to create a new collection.

### Edit the General section

Use the `General` section for collection wide settings.

#### Name the collection.

The collection name must begin with a capital letter.

The name can only contain letters, numbers, and the under-score (_) character. Spaces are not allowed.

#### Select multi-tenancy

[Multi-tenant collections](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/multi-tenancy) are useful if you have multiple users or need data isolation. By default, collections are single tenant. Set the `Multi-tenancy` toggle to enable multi-tenancy.

#### Set a default vectorizer

Set a [vectorizer](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema#vectorizer) for the collection. Weaviate uses the default vectorizer when you import unvectorized data and when Weaviate queries external APIs that require vectorized inputs.

The `Vectorizer` setting is a drop-down list. After you select a vectorizer, the editor expands to let you configure the model.

Deselect the `Vectorize class name` toggle if you don't want to create a vector for the class name.

### Edit the Properties section

Use the `Properties` section to fine-tune individual properties in your collection.

#### Add properties to the collection

Enter property names into the properties editor.

The property names must begin with a lowercase letter.

The names can only contain letters, numbers, and the under-score (_) character. Spaces are not allowed.

#### Configure additional details

Some the property types can be fine tuned. When additional configuration is possible, editor shows a gear wheel next to the `Filterable` toggle.

To update these settings, click on the gear wheel then select the configuration options in the pop-up window.

## Modify a collection

To modify a collection, click the `Collection` option, then select the cluster that hosts the collection that you want to modify. Click the pencil icon near the collection name to open the collection for editing.

## Delete a collection

To delete a collection, click the `Collection` option, then select the cluster that hosts the collection that you want to delete. Click the trash can icon near the collection name to delete the collection.

<center><img src={WCDEdSelect} width="100%" alt="Select to edit or delete"/></center>

Enter the collection name in the text box to confirm, then press `Delete` to remove the collection. Once a collection is deleted it cannot be restored.

## Additional considerations

Weaviate collection schemas are highly configurable and can be tuned in many ways. Some schema elements are modifiable, but many of them cannot be modified after you create the collection. For additional details, see [Collection schema](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema).
