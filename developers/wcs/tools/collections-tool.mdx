The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) Collections tool makes it easy for developers and non-technical users to create, manage, and delete collections.

Use the tool to precisely tune a new collection. Specify a vectorizer and an embedding model. Configure collection properties for faster searches and more accurate results.

## Select a cluster

The collections tool is available for collections that are hosted in Weaviate Cloud.

To begin, select the `Collections` tool from the left hand menu. After you select the collection tool, the `Clusters` panel lists the clusters that are available. Select a cluster from the list to create a new collection or to see the collections that are already in the cluster.

If you don't see any available clusters, select the `Clusters` option from the left hand menu and follow steps to [create a new cluster](/developers/wcs/create-instance).

## Create a collection

The `Create collection` button opens the collection editor. Click the button to create a new collection.

<center><img src={WCDEdColl} width="35%" alt="Create collection"/></center>

### Edit the General section

Use the `General` section for collection wide settings.

<center><img src={WCDEdGen} width="75%" alt="General edit section"/></center>

#### Name the collection.

The collection name must begin with a capital letter.

The name can only contain letters, numbers, and the under-score (_) character. Spaces are not allowed.

#### Select multi-tenancy

[Multi-tenant collections](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/multi-tenancy) are useful if you have multiple users or need data isolation. By default, collections are single tenant. Set the `Multi-tenancy` toggle to enable multi-tenancy.

#### Set a default vectorizer

Set a [vectorizer](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema#vectorizer) for the collection. Weaviate uses the default vectorizer when you import unvectorized data and when Weaviate queries external APIs that require vectorized inputs.

The `Vectorizer` setting is a drop-down list. After you select a vectorizer, the editor expands to let you configure the model.

Deselect the `Vectorize class name` toggle if you don't want to create a vector for the class name.

### Edit the Properties section

Use the `Properties` section to fine-tune individual properties in your collection.

#### Add properties to the collection

Enter property names into the properties editor.

The property names must begin with a lowercase letter.

The names can only contain letters, numbers, and the under-score (_) character. Spaces are not allowed.

<center><img src={WCDEdProp} width="75%" alt="Properties edit section"/></center>

#### Configure additional details

Some the property types can be fine tuned. When additional configuration is possible, editor shows a gear wheel next to the `Filterable` toggle.

To update these settings, click on the gear wheel then select the configuration options in the pop-up window.

<center><img src={WCDEdExProp} width="50%" alt="Properties additional details edit section"/></center>

## Modify a collection

To modify a collection, click the `Collection` option, then select the cluster that hosts the collection that you want to modify. Click the pencil icon near the collection name to open the collection for editing.

<center><img src={WCDEdSelect} width="100%" alt="Select to edit or delete"/></center>

To add a new property to the collection, enter the name and type in the editor. Update additional configuration details if the property type supports them.

<center><img src={WCDEdMod} width="100%" alt="Modify a collection definition"/></center>

Fields that cannot be updated are shown in gray.

## Delete a collection

To delete a collection, click the `Collection` option, then select the cluster that hosts the collection that you want to delete. Click the trash can icon near the collection name to delete the collection.

<center><img src={WCDEdSelect} width="100%" alt="Select to edit or delete"/></center>

Enter the collection name in the text box to confirm, then press `Delete` to remove the collection. Once a collection is deleted it cannot be restored.

<center><img src={WCDEdDelConf} width="75%" alt="Confirm delete"/></center>

## Additional considerations

Weaviate collection schemas are highly configurable and can be tuned in many ways. Some schema elements are modifiable, but many of them cannot be modified after you create the collection. For additional details, see [Collection schema](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema).

The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) query application (query app) is a browser-based GraphQL IDE. Use the query app to work interactively with your WCD clusters.

<center><img src={WCDQueryApp} width="50%" alt="WCD query app"/></center>

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql) is built into the query app. GraphiQL provides many features that make GraphQL easier to use interactively:

- Syntax highlighting
- Intelligent type ahead
- Automatic completion for queries and variables
- Real-time error highlighting and reporting for queries and variables

## Open the query app

To open the query app, connect to your WCD [WCD Dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud).

In the left-hand menu, click the Query app icon.

<center><img src={WCDQueryConsoleLocation} width="25%" alt="WCD query app location"/></center>

## Select a Weaviate instance

The query app connects directly to your WCD clusters. The query app can also connect to other Weaviate instances if you have the proper authorization credentials.

### Connect to a WCD cluster


In this example, the WCD Dashboard is connected to an external instance as well as the two WCD instances.

<center><img src={WCDConnectedInstances} width="100%" alt="Connected instances"/></center>

The GraphQL console can query any of the instances.

To select a cluster, click the `Query` button and chose a cluster from the list that appears.

### Authentication

The query app connects to WCD instances, sandboxes and serverless clusters, without any additional authentication details. The query app can also connect to external Weaviate instances if you have anonymous access enabled or authentication credentials.

### Pass authentication details

import ExternalAuth from '/_includes/wcs/query-auth-details.mdx';

<ExternalAuth/>

### Pass inference keys

To pass API keys for inference modules, use request headers. The `Header` tab is at bottom of the query screen. Add the service inference key to the query headers.

In this example, the `X-OpenAI-Api-Key` header sets the OpenAI API key.

The header can pass multiple keys.
