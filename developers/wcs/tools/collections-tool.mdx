The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) Collections tool makes it easy for developers and non-technical users to create, manage, and delete collections.

Use the tool to precisely tune a new collection. Specify a vectorizer and an embedding model. Configure collection properties for faster searches and more accurate results.

## Select a cluster

The collections tool is available for collections that are hosted in Weaviate Cloud.

To begin, select the `Collections` tool from the left hand menu. After you select the collection tool, the `Clusters` panel lists the clusters that are available. Select a cluster from the list to create a new collection or to see the collections that are already in the cluster.

If you don't see any available clusters, select the `Clusters` option from the left hand menu and follow steps to [create a new cluster](/developers/wcs/create-instance).

#### Name the collection.

The collection name must begin with a capital letter.

The name can only contain letters, numbers, and the under-score (_) character. Spaces are not allowed.

#### Select multi-tenancy

[Multi-tenant collections](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/multi-tenancy) are useful if you have multiple users or need data isolation. By default, collections are single tenant. Set the `Multi-tenancy` toggle to enable multi-tenancy.

#### Set a default vectorizer

Set a [vectorizer](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema#vectorizer) for the collection. Weaviate uses the default vectorizer when you import unvectorized data and when Weaviate queries external APIs that require vectorized inputs.

In addition to the collection level vectorizer, you can also set alternate vectorizers for individual properties and vectors within the collection.

The `Vectorizer` setting is a drop-down list. After you select a vectorizer, the editor expands to let you configure the model.

Deselect the `Vectorize class name` toggle if you don't want to create a vector for the class name.
