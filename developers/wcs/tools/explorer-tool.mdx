The *Explorer* tool provides a graphical interface for inspecting your Weaviate instance that is connected to Weaviate Cloud. Browse collections, examine objects, and inspect metadata and vectors - all without writing code.

## Navigating the Interface

The Explorer tool is organized hierarchically, guiding you from clusters down to individual objects. Follow these steps to navigate through your data.

### Select a cluster

import ExplorerImg1 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-1.png';
import ExplorerImg2 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-2.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg1} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>To begin, select the <code>Explorer</code> tool from the left-hand menu as shown below (item <span class="callout">1</span>).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg2} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>This will load a list of available clusters (item <span class="callout">2</span>). Select a cluster from the list (item <span class="callout">3</span>) to view the collections and objects within that cluster.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

### Explore collections and objects

Once you've selected a cluster, you can dive into your [collections](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data.md#collections) and examine its [objects](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data.md#data-object-concepts).

import ExplorerImg3 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-3.png';
import ExplorerImg4 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-4.png';
import ExplorerImg5 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-5.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg3} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>Selecting a cluster shows a list of available collections (item <span class="callout">4</span>). Select a collection (item <span class="callout">5</span>) to view its objects.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

#### Examining Objects

When you select a collection, Explorer displays its objects in an easy-to-read format. Each object is shown with its:

- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Properties and their values
- Metadata (expandable)
- Vector embeddings

Some details are initially shown as collapsed. Click on the color-coded property group to expand and view the details.

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg4} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>Objects in the selected collection is shown (item <span class="callout">6</span>) as a list of objects. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Each object is listed with its unique ID and its properties (item <span class="callout">7</span>), including the property name and value. Hover over the property name as (item <span class="callout">7a</span>) to see the property type.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg5} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>Click on the color-coded property group such as metadata (item <span class="callout">8</span>) or vectors (item <span class="callout">9</span>) to expand collapsed details.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Vectors are shown initially by its name where <Link to="/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#multiple-vectors-named-vectors">named vectors</Link> are used and number of dimensions. Expand the item further to see some of the vectors, or click `copy` (item <span class="callout">10</span>) to copy the entire vector to clipboard.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

### View as JSON

Explorer offers both a structured view and a raw JSON format.

Toggle between the standard formatted view and JSON view for any object:

- Click the `{}` icon to switch to JSON view
- Click again to return to the formatted view
- The JSON view shows the complete object structure, including all nested properties, metadata, and vectors

import ExplorerImg6 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-6.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg6} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>View an object in JSON format (item <span class="callout">11</span>) by clicking the <code>{}</code> icon (item <span class="callout">12</span>). Return to the object view by clicking the same icon again.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

### Pagination & Refresh

When viewing a collection with many objects, pagination controls are available at the bottom of the list. Use these controls to navigate through the objects.

Additionally, the refresh button at the top of the page allows you to update the list of objects in the collection.

import ExplorerImg7 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-7.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg7} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>When viewing a collection with many objects, pagination controls (item <span class="callout">13</span>) are available at the bottom of the list. Use these controls to navigate through the objects.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The number of objects per page can be adjusted using the dropdown (item <span class="callout">14</span>), where the total number of objects in the collection is also shown.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The "refresh" button (item <span class="callout">15</span>) at the top right of the page allows you to update the list of objects in the collection.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
