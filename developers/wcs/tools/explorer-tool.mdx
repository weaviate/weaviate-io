The *Explorer* tool provides a graphical interface for inspecting your Weaviate instance that is connected to Weaviate Cloud. Browse collections, examine objects, and inspect metadata and vectors - all without writing code.

## Navigating the Interface

The Explorer tool is organized hierarchically, guiding you from clusters down to individual objects. Follow these steps to navigate through your data.

### Select a cluster

import ExplorerImg1 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-1.png';
import ExplorerImg2 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-2.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg1} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>To begin, select the <code>Explorer</code> tool from the left-hand menu as shown below (item 1).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg2} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>This will load a list of available clusters (item 2). Select a cluster from the list (item 3) to view the collections and objects within that cluster.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

### Explore collections and objects

Once you've selected a cluster, you can dive into your [collections](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data.md#collections) and examine its [objects](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data.md#data-object-concepts).

import ExplorerImg3 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-3.png';
import ExplorerImg4 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-4.png';
import ExplorerImg5 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-5.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg3} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>Selecting a cluster shows a list of available collections (item 4). Select a collection (item 5) to view its objects.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

#### Examining Objects

When you select a collection, Explorer displays its objects in an easy-to-read format. Each object is shown with its:

- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Properties and their values
- Metadata (expandable)
- Vector embeddings

Some details are initially shown as collapsed. Click on the color-coded property group to expand and view the details.

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg4} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>Objects in the selected collection is shown (item 6) as a list of objects. Each object is listed with its unique ID and its properties (item 7), including the property name and value.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg5} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>Click on the color-coded property group such as metadata (item 8) or vectors (item 9) to expand collapsed details.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Vectors are shown initially by its name where <a href="/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#multiple-vectors-named-vectors">named vectors</a> are used and number of dimensions. Expand the item further to see some of the vectors, or click `copy` (item 10) to copy the entire vector to clipboard.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

### View as JSON

Explorer offers both a structured view and a raw JSON format.

Toggle between the standard formatted view and JSON view for any object:

- Click the `{}` icon to switch to JSON view
- Click again to return to the formatted view
- The JSON view shows the complete object structure, including all nested properties, metadata, and vectors

import ExplorerImg6 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-6.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg6} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>View an object in JSON format (item 11) by clicking the <code>{}</code> icon (item 12). Return to the object view by clicking the same icon again.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

### Pagination

When viewing a collection with many objects, pagination controls are available at the bottom of the list. Use these controls to navigate through the objects.

import ExplorerImg7 from '/developers/wcs/img/explorer-7.png';

<div class="row">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card__image">
            <img src={ExplorerImg7} alt="Explorer Tool"/>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>When viewing a collection with many objects, pagination controls (item 13) are available at the bottom of the list. Use these controls to navigate through the objects.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The number of objects per page can be adjusted using the dropdown (item 14), where the total number of objects in the collection is also shown.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
