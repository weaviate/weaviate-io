## Overview

This page will show you how to create a Weaviate instance on Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS).

### Preparation

- You will need a WCS account.
- We offer WCS instances at different service level access (SLA) tiers, including a free "sandbox" tier. Please review their [details and pricing here](/pricing) and select one that suits you best.

import SandBoxExpiry from '/_includes/sandbox.expiry.mdx';

<SandBoxExpiry/>

## Instance creation steps

1. Visit the [WCS dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud/dashboard) under your WCS account.
1. Select your preferred SLA tier.
    1. In order to create a paid-tier (i.e. non-sandbox) instance, you must first add your billing info in WCS. We will contact you separately to arrange billing.
1. Enter a unique instance name (note: this is **not** the same as your instance URL).
1. Select (if applicable):
    1. Whether to enable authentication, and
    1. The host region.
1. Lastly, when you are ready - click "Create" to create your cluster.

## Important notes

### Authentication

WCS instances are typically configured with authentication enabled, except for sandboxes, for which authentication is optional.

Please see our [authentication](./authentication.mdx) page for instructions and tips on how to authenticate against a WCS instance.

### Instance version update

As later versions of Weaviate are released, you will have the ability to update your WCS instance to run on a later version.

Please note that due to testing and configuration work required in incorporating a version of Weaviate onto WCS, there may be a small delay between the release of a new Weaviate version and its availability on WCS.
