1. Select your preferred SLA tier.
1. Enter a unique instance name (note: this is **not** the same as your instance URL).

    1. Whether to enable authentication, and
    1. The host region.
1. Lastly, when you are ready - click "Create" to create your cluster.

### Instance version update

As later versions of Weaviate are released, you will have the ability to update your WCS instance to run on a later version.

Please note that due to testing and configuration work required in incorporating a version of Weaviate onto WCS, there may be a small delay between the release of a new Weaviate version and its availability on WCS.
