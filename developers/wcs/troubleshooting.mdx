## Account Troubleshooting

### Password reset

You can reset your password if you forgot it, or simply want to change it. To do so, navigate to the WCS login page and click <kbd>Forgot Password</kbd>.

### Where is my verification email?

If you did not receive a verification email, please check your spam folder. If you still cannot find it, you can try again using the same steps as the [password reset](#password-reset).
