# intro: How-to guides help you to get more familiar with Weaviate. You will learn how to get started, how to interact with the data, how to perform more advanced actions like semantic search and classification, and how to interpret and evaluate the results. These guides are more elaborate then the API references, to give you some background idea which might help you to understand the workflow and possibilities.

## Overview 

<!-- TODO - all the child pages generally outdated. Need work to clean up / update / create -->
These **further** tutorials are somewhat narrower in scope, to show you how to achieve specific goals and tasks. Think of these as specific recipes, unlike [essential tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) which are more like cooking lessons. 

Whether you read these tutorials will be mostly dependent on whether you would like to make the specific dish - that is, whether the topic of the tutorial is relevant to you. It can also be a great way to see what Weaviate is capable of.
