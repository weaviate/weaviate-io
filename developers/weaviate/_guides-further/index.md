## Overview

<!-- TODO - all the child pages generally outdated. Need work to clean up / update / create -->
These **further** tutorials are somewhat narrower in scope, to show you how to achieve specific goals and tasks. Think of these as specific recipes, unlike [essential tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) which are more like cooking lessons.

Whether you read these tutorials will be mostly dependent on whether you would like to make the specific dish - that is, whether the topic of the tutorial is relevant to you. It can also be a great way to see what Weaviate is capable of.
