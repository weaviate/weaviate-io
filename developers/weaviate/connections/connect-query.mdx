The [Query application (query app)](/developers/wcs/console) is a browser-based GraphQL IDE. The Query app is available in the Weaviate Cloud (WCD) console.

Use the query app to work interactively with clusters hosted in Weaviate Cloud and self-hosted instances too.

## Open the query app

To use the query app, open your [WCD Dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud).

In the left-hand menu, click the Query app icon.

## Select a Weaviate instance

The query app connects directly to your WCD clusters. The query app can also connect to external Weaviate instances if you have anonymous access enabled or authentication credentials.

To select a cluster, Click the `Query` button and choose a cluster from the clusters list.

### Pass authentication details

import ExternalAuth from '/_includes/wcs/query-auth-details.mdx';

<ExternalAuth/>

### Pass inference keys

To pass API keys for inference modules, use request headers.

The header can pass multiple keys.

```shell
{
 "X-Cohere-Api-key": "replaceWithYourCohereKey",
 "X-HuggingFace-Api-key": "replaceWithYourHuggingFaceKey",
 "X-OpenAI-Api-key": "replaceWithYourOpenAIKey",
}
```

## Example query

This example uses [keyword search](/developers/weaviate/search/bm25) to query a movie database. The [GraphiQL editor](https://graphqleditor.com/docs/) helps you to build the query on the left hand side of the screen. When you run the query, it displays the results on the right hand side.
