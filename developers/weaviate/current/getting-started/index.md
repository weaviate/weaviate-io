Welcome to the Weaviate **Getting Started** guide.

The Getting Started is designed to quickly teach you how to use Weaviate, from spinning up an instance to performing queries. Each section should just take a few minutes of your time.

In this guide, we will show you how to:
- Spin up an instance of Weaviate
- Set up a database schema, including cross-references
- Import data to populate the database, and
- Perform queries to retrieve relevant data 

By the end of the guide, you will end up with a basic, but fully functioning vector database. You will also have performed vector searches to retrieve information from that database.

Have fun working with Weaviate, and please do let us know when you have questions or if you have a cool use case to share!

## Before you start 

The guide assumes that you are somewhat familiar with databases and vector embeddings. 

But don't worry too much even if you are uncomfortable with any of these. The guide is structured so you should be able to follow along even if some of the concepts are unfamiliar. And you can always revisit some of these ideas in the documentation. 

## Next

Get started by [installing Weaviate](./installation.html).
