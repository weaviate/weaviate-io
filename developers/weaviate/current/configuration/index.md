When setting up a Weaviate instance, by default, it will by default:
- With the [vector index type](./vector-index-type.html) `hnsw`. This will be configurable soon.
- Without any form of authentication and authorization. Check the pages about [authentication](./authentication.html) and [authorization](./authorization.html) how to enable this.

How to configure your docker-compose file, check the [Installation page](../getting-started/installation.html#docker-compose).

For configuration of your data schema, check the [Tutorial](../tutorials/how-to-create-a-schema.html) or the [data schema reference page](../schema/schema-configuration.html).
