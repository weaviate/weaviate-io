**The collection count limit will be introduced in the near future.**
:::

:::caution You hit the collections count limit?
If you see an error that the collection count limit has been reached, it means you **can't create any more collections** because the number of collections is affecting performance. This limit exists to control indexing, storage, and management complexity.<br /><br />
**Instead of simply raising the limit, consider rethinking your architecture**. If you really need to change the limit, use the [`MAXIMUM_ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS_COUNT`](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars) environment variable.

This guide offers an overview of the available architectural choices of using **multi-tenancy** or defining a **dedicated collection** for each subset of data.

Consider a scenario where you are developing a SaaS platform for product recommendations, allowing users (merchants) to import and vectorize their product data. The users of this platform require the ability to efficiently perform vector searches to generate personalized recommendations for users on their respective e-commerce platforms.

One option is creating a dedicated collection for each user to store their product data. However, as the number of users grows, so does the number of collections, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks and increased operational complexity. This leads us to an important question: **How many collections is too many?**

## Structuring data in a vector database

        alt='Multi-tenancy vs "One collection per user" architecture'
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

When designing a vector database collection definition (data schema), you must decide between **multi-tenancy** (storing data for multiple tenants in a single collection) or creating **separate collections for each data subset** (the "One collection per user" strategy). Each approach has its own advantages and trade-offs, especially in terms of performance, scalability, and management.

This guide aims to clarify these concepts and highlight the implications of each approach, focusing on the benefits and drawbacks:

- **["One collection per user" architecture](#one-collection-per-tenant-architecture)**
- **[Multi-tenancy architecture](#multi-tenancy-architecture)**

### "One collection per user" architecture

In this approach, **each user is assigned a dedicated collection** to ensure the separation of data between them. Before the implementation of multi-tenancy in Weaviate this was the best approach for managing data for multiple users.

import MultipleCollectionsExample from '/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/img/weaviate-multiple-collections-example.png';

<div class="row">
  <div class="col col--4">
    <p>
      When a "book store" registers on our platform, we create the collection{' '}
      <code>BookStoreProducts</code> for that user's products. This allows
      them to customize the collection and add properties that are specific to
      their e-commerce platform, like author, title, genre, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      Creating a new collection per user (<code>ShoeStoreProducts</code>, <code>
        GameStoreProduct
      </code>, etc.) might seem like a simple and effective way to maintain data
      isolation. However, as the platform scales, this approach quickly encounters
      significant challenges.

        <img
          src={MultipleCollectionsExample}
          alt='"One collection per user" architecture example'
        />
      </div>
      <div class="card__body">
        "One collection per user" architecture example.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

#### Advantages

- **Customizability**: Collection definition changes or optimizations can be tailored to individual collections without affecting others.
- **Simpler queries**: Queries do not require user-specific filters, as each collection inherently belongs to a single user.
- **Data isolation**: Each user's data is completely separated through the use of dedicated collections.

#### Challenges

- **Resource overhead:** Each collection requires its own definition, indexes, and storage, leading to increased memory and disk usage. Managing thousands or even millions of collections becomes nearly impossible.
- **Operational complexity:** Collection definition changes must be applied individually to each collection. Every collection must be updated separately and this takes a lot of time and computational effort.
- **Query performance:** Retrieving data across multiple collections can be inefficient, especially when performing global analytics (e.g., searching throughout multiple collections).

:::tip
If you are creating more than `20` collections, take a moment to consider if multi-tenancy might be utilized.

### Multi-tenancy architecture

Multi-tenancy refers to the practice of using a single collection to store data for multiple users (tenants). Each tenantâ€™s data is logically isolated through the use of tenant names. Multi-tenancy is especially useful when you want to store data for multiple customers or when you want to store similarly structured data for multiple projects.

import MultiTenancyExample from '/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/img/weaviate-multi-tenancy-example.png';

<div class="row">
  <div class="col col--4">
    <br />
    <p>
      Each tenant is identified by their name, ensuring that their products
      remain logically separated within the same collection. When a "book store"
      registers on our platform, we can create a new tenant called{' '}
      <code>BookStore</code> in the collection <code>Products</code>.
      <br />
      <br />
      Queries can also be filtered based on the name to retrieve only the relevant
      data.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col col--8">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card__image">
        <img
          src={MultiTenancyExample}
          alt="Multi-tenancy architecture example"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="card__body">Multi-tenancy architecture example.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

#### Advantages

Use multi-tenancy when you need to support a large number of tenants and prioritize resource efficiency and scalability.

- **Easier collection definition management:** Definition updates apply universally to all tenants. For example, adding a new property to all products is now much easier.
- **Optimized query performance:** Queries can leverage the tenant name to retrieve only the relevant products. You also don't have to keep track of what collections are associated with what tenants.
- **Index scalability**: Indexes can be optimized for a single collection rather than fragmented across multiple collections. Each tenant has a dedicated, high-performance vector index, which results in faster query speeds. Instead of searching a shared index space, each tenant responds as if it were the only user on the cluster.
- **Data isolation**: Each tenantâ€™s data is completely segregated. This also means that data deletion is much easier and faster.

#### Challenges

- **Access control complexity**: [Fine-grained access control](/developers/weaviate/configuration/authorization) must be implemented to ensure data isolation between tenants.

:::tip Reduce storage costs
You can change the [state of a tenant](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/managing-resources/tenant-states) into `inactive` (stored locally on disk) or `offloaded` (stored on cloud storage) in order to save resources.

## Conclusion

While the choice between multi-tenancy and dedicated collections depends on your specific use case, the substantial **performance benefits of multi-tenancy** make it the preferred approach for most scenarios. With multi-tenancy, you gain significant resource efficiency by reducing indexing overhead and streamlining collection definition updates across all tenants.

Although dedicated collections can offer enhanced data isolation and flexibility in certain cases, their operational complexity and increased resource demands often outweigh these benefits. Regularly monitoring query performance, index size, and resource utilization is crucial to fine-tune your architecture, ensuring it meets both current and future needs.
