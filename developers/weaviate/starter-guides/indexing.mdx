## Recommendations

Most applications benefit from indexing.

- The cost savings are significant. In [Weaviate Cloud](https://weaviate.io/pricing), for example, compressed collections can be more than 80% cheaper than uncompressed collections.
- If you have a small collection that uses a flat index, consider a BQ index. The BQ index is 32 times smaller and much, much faster
