Use indexes to improve search speeds.

## Overview

Weaviate stores objects and vector representations of those objects (vectors). Objects also have properties. Properties have their own indexes. This page introduces [vector indexes](#vector-indexes) and [property indexes](#property-indexes).

## Indexing methods

By default, Weaviate uses an uncompressed HNSW index for vectors. Properties use an inverted keyword index. Two configurations are enabled by default, `indexSearchable` and `indexFilterable`.

### Vector indexes

#### HNSW indexes

[Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#hierarchical-navigable-small-world-hnsw-index) is an algorithm that works on multi-layered graphs. It is also an index type, and refers to vector indexes that are created using the HNSW algorithm. HNSW indexes enable very fast queries, but rebuilding the index when you add new vectors can be resource intensive.

#### Flat indexes

[Flat indexes](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#flat-index)

#### Dynamic indexes

[Dynamic indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#dynamic-index) are new in v1.25. This type of index is a flat index until a collection reaches a threshold size. When the collection grows larger than the threshold size, the collection is automatically reindexed and converted to an HNSW index.

The dynamic index only changes once. If the collection ever shrinks below the threshold size, it does not change back to a flat index.

The default threshold value to change from a flat index to an HNSW index is 10,000 objects.

This chart shows how a dynamic index changes as the number of objects in a collection grows. The chart assumes [compression](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/compression) is enabled on the flat index and on the HNSW index.

| Number of objects | Index type | Compression | Notes |
| :- | :- | :- |
| 0 - 9,999 | Flat index | BQ | The index is on disk, BQ compression is active. |
| 10,000 | Conversion | None | The flat index converts to HNSW. The index is stored in RAM. |
| 100,000 | HNSW | Training | The collection has enough training data for PQ or SQ compression to start. |
| 100,001 | HNSW | SQ or PQ | Compression is active. |

### Property indexes

Keyword search, also known as BM25 search, uses an inverted index. Weaviate uses inverted indexes to search properties.

## Indexing considerations

- Indexing adds computational overhead when you import data. Starting in v1.2

- If you don't need to search on a property, consider turning indexing off to save space.

## Recommendations

- If your object count is low, consider a flat index. For larger data sets, use an HNSW index. Configure a dynamic index if you object count is low now but will grow.

- Uncompressed vector indexes can use significant resources. Consider using [compression](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/compression) to minimize resource requirements. Compression helps to control costs and give you room to load more objects in memory.

- If you anticipate making range queries on numerical properties, enable the range filter index.

- If you don't anticipate querying a property, turn off indexing to conserve space.
