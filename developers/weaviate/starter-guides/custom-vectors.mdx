## Overview

As a vector database, Weaviate make use of vector representations, also known as "embeddings", of data objects.

One way to generate these vectors is to use a ["vectorizer" module](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/index.md), which will generate a vector at import and query time. This can be a convenient method if you are using a publicly available model and want to simplify your pipeline.

Alternatively, you can supply your own, "custom", vector embeddings at import time as well as for any vector-based queries. This is useful if you have a custom model, or if you want to use a model that is not available through a Weaviate module.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using Weaviate with your own vectors. We will:

1. Create a Weaviate instance
2. Connect to the Weaviate instance
3. Import your data, specifying your own vectors
4. Perform a vector search with Weaviate


## Data

We'll use as an example a tiny dataset consisting of 10 questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!". Each object has an associated vector embedding.

In this example, these vectors were obtained through an OpenAI API, using the <nobr>[`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)</nobr>. But your vectors can come from any source, such as another inference service provider (e.g Cohere or Hugging Face) or your own fine-tuned model.

## Installation

Weaviate is open source and you can easily [run the binary on Linux](../installation/embedded.md) or [run a local instance from a Docker image](../installation/docker-compose.md) on any OS, or even easier - you can create a free sandbox instance with the [Weaviate Cloud Services](../../wcs/quickstart.mdx) (WCS).

For this example, we will assume that you are using a WCS instance with authentication enabled.


## Client library

For the best experience with Weaviate, we recommend installing a Weaviate client library for one of these languages:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart/clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

For JavaScript/TypeScript, we'll also need the `node-fetch` library to download the dataset, so make sure to `npm install node-fetch`.

## Connect to Weaviate

To connect to your Weaviate instance, you need the following information:

- The Weaviate **URL** (get it from WCS `Details` tab),
- The Weaviate **API key** (if enabled - get it from WCS `Details` tab), and

Run the following example code to connect to Weaviate. You can re-use the resulting `client` object in the following steps.

import ConnectToWeaviate from '/_includes/code/quickstart/connect.noheader.mdx'

<ConnectToWeaviate />

## Collection definition

Weaviate [stores data](../concepts/data.md) objects in collections, each of which is called a `class`. Each object has a set of properties, and a vector representation generated automatically by a vectorizer, or specified at import time.

Weaviate lets you define vectorizers at the class level, with further control (e.g. specific model, or vectorization behavior) at the property level. Since you're bringing your own vectors, a vectorizer is not needed, so we will set the vectorizer to `none` here.

:::note Optional: Set a **compatible** vectorizer
If you're using "custom" vectors that utilize the same model available through a Weaviate module, you have the option to **designate that specific model and module** as the class vectorizer.<p><br/></p>

In this tutorial, the vectors were produced using the OpenAI model `ada-002`. As this model is also available through the `text2vec-openai` module, it may be set as the class vectorizer. Doing so will enable Weaviate to generate vectors if any objects are upserted without a vector, and enable the [`nearText` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#neartext).<p><br/></p>

Note that if a class has a specified vectorizer but you provide a vector at the time of import, Weaviate will use your supplied vector.
:::

import CreateSchema from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.schema.mdx'

<CreateSchema />


## Import data with vectors

Here is the set of [10 pre-vectorized Jeopardy questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny+vectors.json) in JSON format.

The following will load the question objects with vectors, and import them to Weaviate.

Note that we use a batch import process, so that each request to the inference API contains multiple objects. You should use batch imports unless you have a good reason not to, as it will significantly improve the speed of data ingestion.

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

<ImportQuestionsWithVectors />

:::tip vector != object property
Do *not* specify object vectors as an object property. This will cause Weaviate to treat it as a regular property, rather than as a vector embedding.
:::

## Query

Let's say you want to find questions related to biology. We can do that by obtaining a vector embedding for "biology", and finding objects nearest to it.
In this example, we've used the OpenAI API to generate it, with the same [`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings). Then, in the following query, we pass that vector to the [`nearVector` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#nearvector):

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart/response.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />

## Recap

If you made it here - well done. We have covered a lot, and you've successfully built a fully functioning vector database! 🥳

You have:
- Populated your Weaviate instance with your own vectors, and
- Performed text similarity searches.

Of course, there is a lot more to Weaviate that we have not yet covered, and probably a lot that you wish to know about. So we include a few links below that might help you to get started in your journey with us.
