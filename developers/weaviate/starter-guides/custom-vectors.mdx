Weaviate is a vector database. [Vector databases](/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) store data objects and vectors that represent those objects. When you import a data object, you normally include a vector representation of that object as well. The vector representation is also called an "embedding."

Later, when you work with the stored vectors, Weaviate uses a vectorized version of your query to search the vector space.

This guide discusses importing data that already has vectors. An alternative approach is to use a [vectorizer](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/index.md) model that generates vectors at import time. Queries have to be vectorized using the same vectorizer as the data objects. When you define your collection schema, be sure to define the same vectorizer that you use to vectorize the data.

Weaviate supports embeddings generated by popular third party services and custom vector embeddings that you create. For details on how to connect your client application to a vectorizer, see the follow pages:

- [Supported models](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules)
- [Custom models](/developers/weaviate/modules/other-modules/custom-modules)

## Guide outline

This guide uses a free sandbox in [Weaviate Cloud](/developers/wcs/sandbox). If you don't have a Weaviate Cloud account, you can [create one](/developers/wcs/create-account) or else follow along on a Weaviate instance of your own.

Follow these steps to import data that includes vectors.

1. [Create a sandbox instance](create-a-sandbox-instance)
1. [Connect to your sandbox](connect-to-your-sandbox)
1. [Prepare the collection](prepare-the-collection)
1. [Import the data](import-the-data)

## Create a sandbox instance

Follow these steps to create a sandbox instance.

### Login to Weaviate Cloud

1. Open the [WCD login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) in a browser.
1. Click `Login to Weaviate Cloud Services`.
1. Enter your email address and password to authenticate.

### Create a sandbox cluster

To create a cluster, click the 'Create cluster' button on the WCD Dashboard page.

import CreateClusterButton from '/developers/wcs/img/wcs-create-cluster-button.jpg';

<center><img src={CreateClusterButton} width="75%" alt="Create cluster button"/></center>

import CreateSandboxCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-sandbox.mdx'

<CreateSandboxCluster />

## Connect to your sandbox

Follow these steps to connect to your sandbox instance.

### Get the connection details

To connect to your sandbox instance, you need the following information:

- The Weaviate sandbox URL
- The Weaviate sandbox API key

To get the cluster URL and authentication details, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button to open the Details panel.

import DetailsButton from '/developers/wcs/img/wcs-details-icon.jpg';

<center><img src={DetailsButton} width="75%" alt="Details button"/></center>

Copy the REST endpoint.

import RESTEndPoint from '/developers/wcs/img/wcs-rest-endpoint.jpg';

<center><img src={RESTEndPoint} width="75%" alt="Details button"/></center>

2. To get the API keys, click the `API keys` button.

import DetailsAPIKey from '/developers/wcs/img/wcs-console-details-api-key.jpg';

<center><img src={DetailsAPIKey} width="75%" alt="Details API Key"/></center>

Copy the Weaviate API key.

### Connect to a Weaviate instance

To connect to your sandbox, edit this sample code to use your Weaviate sandbox URL and your Weaviate API key. You will use this client later when you upload your data.

This guide demonstrates how import data objects that already have vectors. If you import data that has to be vectorized, your client connection code should also [include the API key](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/connect#third-party-api-keys) for the vectorizer API.

import ConnectToWeaviate from '/_includes/code/quickstart/connect.noheader.mdx'

<ConnectToWeaviate />

## Prepare the collection

Weaviate stores [data](../concepts/data.md) in collections. Each object has a set of properties and a vector representation. Before you import data, you should create a [collection schema](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema) to define collection properties and the vectorizer. Vectorizers are defined at the collection level. You can also define specific details at the property level.

When you import data objects that don't have vectors, Weaviate uses the vectorizer details to create vectors at import time. If the imported data objects do have vectors, Weaviate uses those vectors instead of generating new ones.

The vectorizer that you specify in the collection schema must be the same vectorizer that you use to vectorize the data objects. If the vectorizers are different, vector search results are meaningless.

### Create a collection schema

Collection schemas are highly configurable. If you don't provide values for all of the parameters, the auto-schema feature attempts to provide the missing values during import.

In this example, the vectors are generated by an OpenAI model, `ada-002`. Weaviate provides a module, `text2vec-openai`, that can access the OpenAI model. The schema definition specifies the `text2vec-openai` vectorizer so queries and later inserts will use the same vectorizer.

Objects have vectors and properties. Be careful not to specify your vectors as properties. Weaviate processes vector embeddings and properties differently.

## Import the data

The example data is based on a [set of ten questions](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/_resources/jeopardy_10_vectors.json) from the "Jeopardy!" television program. Each of the objects contains the following elements:

- A vector embedding
- A question
- A category
- An answer

You can use any vectorizer. In this example, OpenAI is the vectorizer. The question, answer, and category are the raw data. The vector embedding is the vector OpenAI returns after processing the raw data.

Create a json formatted data file to use in your import. In this example, the [data file](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/_resources/jeopardy_10_vectors.json) is already prepared.

This [batch import](/developers/weaviate/tutorials/import#batch-import-process) code imports the question objects, including their vectors. Batch import is more efficient than importing individual objects. You should use batch imports when you import large amounts of data.

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

## Query

Let's say you want to find questions related to biology. We can do that by obtaining a vector embedding for "biology", and finding objects nearest to it.
In this example, we've used the OpenAI API to generate it, with the same [`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings). Then, in the following query, we pass that vector to the [`nearVector` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#nearvector):

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart/response.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />
