## Introduction
This page will include comparisons of vectorizers, to help our users better understand the technical difference between vectorizers.

The separate [guide on vectorizer selection](../tutorials/how-to-select-the-right-vectorizer.md) will include practical help and guidance for users (i.e. non-DS professionals or academics) on what vectorizer might be best for their data and use case.
