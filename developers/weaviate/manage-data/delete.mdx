## Overview

This page will show you how to delete objects in Weaviate by their id or a set of criteria.

:::info See also
- [References: REST - /v1/objects](../api/rest/objects.md#delete-a-data-object)
:::


## Requirements

To delete a specific object, you'll need its [id](../api/graphql/additional-properties.md#id) and class name.

To delete objects by a set of criteria, you'll need their class name, and a `where` filter.

:::tip Multi-tenancy
For classes where [multi-tenancy](../concepts/data.md#multi-tenancy) is enabled, you will also need to specify the tenant name when deleting objects. See [Manage data: multi-tenancy operations](./multi-tenancy.md) for details on how.

## Delete object by id

To delete an object, specify its class name and id as shown below.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START DeleteObject"
      endMarker="# END DeleteObject"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START DeleteObject"
      endMarker="// END DeleteObject"
      language="ts"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip REST endpoint
You can also [make a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/objects` endpoint](../api/rest/objects.md#delete-a-data-object) directly.
:::


<!-- ## Error handling

If the id doesn't exist in the specified class, a 404 error will be returned.

You can handle errors as follows:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START DeleteError"
      endMarker="# END DeleteError"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START DeleteError"
      endMarker="// END DeleteError"
      language="ts"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> -->


## Delete multiple objects

To delete multiple objects that match a set of criteria, specify the class and a [`where` filter](../search/similarity.md).

Optionally, set `output` to `'verbose'` to see more details (ID and deletion status).

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START DeleteBatch"
      endMarker="# END DeleteBatch"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START DeleteBatch"
      endMarker="// END DeleteBatch"
      language="ts"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip REST endpoint
You can also make [`DELETE` request to the `/v1/batch/objects` endpoint](../api/rest/batch.md#batch-delete) directly.
:::

:::info Limit per query
There is a configurable [maximum limit](../api/rest/batch.md#maximum-number-of-deletes-per-query) on the number of objects that can be deleted in a single query (default 10,000). To delete more objects than the limit, re-run the query.
:::


### Dry-run

You can set the [`dryRun` option](../api/rest/batch.md#dry-run-before-deletion) to check how many objects would be deleted, without actually performing the deletion.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START DryRun"
      endMarker="# END DryRun"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START DryRun"
      endMarker="// END DryRun"
      language="ts"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<details>
  <summary>Example response</summary>

It should produce a response like the one below:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultsDryRun"
  endMarker="# END ResultsDryRun"
  language="json"
/>

</details>
