## Overview

These how-to **manage data** guides aim to help you do just that, such as perform CRUD operations using Weaviate.

import BasicPrereqs from '/_includes/prerequisites-quickstart.md';

<BasicPrereqs />

We have separate how-to guides for:

- [Create objects](./create.mdx): How to create individual objects.
- [Read objects](./read.mdx): How to read individual objects.
- [Read all objects](./read-all-objects.mdx): How to read all objects, e.g. to manually back up a class.
- [Update objects](./update.mdx): Update objects.
- [Delete objects](./delete.mdx): Delete individual objects or filtered object groups.
- [Import items](./import.mdx): For bulk imports of data.
- [Cross-references](./cross-references.mdx): For managing cross-references.

Each guide is self-contained. So you can read them in any order.
