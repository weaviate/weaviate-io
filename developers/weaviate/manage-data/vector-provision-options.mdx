## Overview

When importing objects into Weaviate, you can choose to provide object vectors to Weaviate, or configure a Weaviate vectorizer to obtain vectors at import time. You can even combine these options to configure a vectorizer while explicitly providing vectors.

This **5-minute video** provides an overview of all three workflows, with code examples shown in Python.

### Prerequisites

We recommend that you go through the [Quickstart tutorial](../quickstart/index.md) before watching this video, or at least make sure you are familiar with the basic of a schema, import, and query in Weaviate.

### Jupyter notebook & data

You can find the accompanying Jupyter notebook and data at [this repository](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/vector-provision-options).
