# Introduction

Weaviate's `v1.8.0` release introduces the ability to run Weaviate on a set of
multiple nodes in a cluster as opposed to running on a single machine.

# Motivation to scale Weaviate

Generally there are (at least) three distinct motivations to scale out
horizontally which all will lead to different setups.

## Motivation 1: Maximum Dataset Size

Due to the [memory footprint of an HNSW
graph](./resources.html#the-role-of-memory) it may be desirable to
spread a dataset across multiple servers ("nodes"). In such a setup, a single
class index is composed of multiple shards and shards are spread across
servers. 

Weaviate does the required orchestration at import and query time fully
automatically. The only adjustment required is to specify the desired shard count.
See [Sharding vs Replication](#sharding-vs-replication) below for trade-offs
involved when running multiple shards.

**Solution: Sharding across multiple nodes in a cluster**

*Note: The ability to shard across a cluster was added in Weaviate `v1.8.0`.*

## Motivation 2: Higher Query Throughput

When you receive more queries than a single Weaviate node can handle, it is
desirable to add more Weaviate nodes which can help in responding to your
users' queries.

Instead of sharding across multiple nodes, you can replicate (the same data)
across multiple nodes. This process also happens fully automatically and you
only need to specify the desired replication factor. Sharding and replication
can also be combined.

**Solution: Replicate your classes across multiple nodes in a cluster**

*Note: The ability to replicate classes is currently under development and
subject to a future release. See Weaviate's [Architectural
Roadmap](../architecture/roadmap.html)*

## Motivation 3: High Availability

When serving critical loads with Weaviate, it may be desirable to be able to
keep serving queries even if a node fails completely. Such a failure could be
either due to a software or OS-level crash or even a hardware issue. Other than
unexpected crashes, a highly available setup can also tolerate zero-downtime
updates and other maintenance tasks.

To run a highly available setup, classes must be replicated among multiple
nodes.

*Note: The ability to replicate classes is currently under development and
subject to a future release. See Weaviate's [Architectural
Roadmap](../architecture/roadmap.html)*

# Sharding vs Replication

The motivation sections above outline when it is desirable to shard your
classes across multiple nodes and when it is desirable to replicate your
classes - or both. This section highlights the implications of a sharded and/or
replicated setup.

*Note: All of the scenarios below assume that - as sharding or replication is
increased - the cluster size is adapted accordingly. If the number of shards
or the replication factor is lower than the number of nodes in the cluster, the
advantages no longer apply.*

*Note: The ability to replicate classes is currently under development and
subject to a future release. See Weaviate's [Architectural
Roadmap](../architecture/roadmap.html)*

## Advantages when increasing sharding
* Run larger datasets
* Speed up imports

## Disadvantages when increasing sharding
* Query throughput does not improve when adding more sharded nodes

## Advantages when increasing replication
* System becomes highly available
* Increased replication leads to near-linearly increased query throughput

## Disadvantages when increasing replication
* Import speed does not improve when adding more replicated nodes

# Sharding Keys ("Partitioning Keys")

Weaviate uses specific characteristics of an object to decide which shard it
belongs to. As of `v1.8.0`, a sharding key is always the object's UUID. The
sharding algorithm is a 64bit Murmur-3 hash. Other properties and other
algorithms for sharding may be added in the future.

# Resharding

Weaviate uses a virtual shard system to assign objects to shards. This makes it
more efficient to re-shard, as minimal data movement occurs when re-sharding.
However, due to the HNSW index, resharding is still a very costly process and
should be used rarely. The cost of resharding is roughly that of an
initial import with regards to the amount of data that needs to be moved.

Example - assume the following scenario: A class is comprised of 4 shards and taking
60 minutes to import all data. When changing the sharding count to 5, each shard
will roughly transfer 20% of its data to the new shard. This is equivalent to
an import of 20% of the dataset, so the expected time for this process would be
~12 minutes.

*Note: The groundwork to be able to re-shard has been laid by using Weaviate's
Virtual shard system. Re-sharding however is not yet implemented and not
currently prioritized. See Weaviate's [Architectural
Roadmap](../architecture/roadmap.html)*.

# Node Discovery

Nodes in a cluster use a gossip-like protocol through [Hashicorp's
Memberlist](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist) to communicate node state
and failure scenarios.

Weaviate - especially when running as a cluster - is optimized to run on
Kubernetes. The [Weaviate Helm
chart](../getting-started/installation.html#kubernetes-k8s) makes use of a
`StatefulSet` and a headless `Service` that automatically configures node
discovery. All you have to do is specify the desired node count.

# Node affinity of shards and/or replication shards

As of `v1.8.0`, users cannot specify the node-affinity of a specific shard or
replication shard. Shards are assigned to 'live' nodes in a round-robin fashion
starting with a random node. There are not yet any mechanisms in place to make
sure that a new class' shards are owned by the node that currently has the
least work. Similarly, there is no way to assign specific classes to
specific nodes if nodes aren't equally sized in the cluster.

Such node-affinity labels and/or rules may be added in future releases.

# Consistency and current limitations

* Changes to the schema are strongly consistent across nodes, whereas changes to
  data aim to be eventually consistent.
* As of `v1.8.0`, the process of broadcasting schema changes across the cluster
  uses a form of two-phase transaction that as of now cannot tolerate node
  failures during the lifetime of the transaction.
* As of `v1.8.0`, replication is currently under development. ([See
  Roadmap](../architecture/roadmap.html)).
* As of `v1.8.0`, dynamically scaling a cluster is not fully supported yet. New
  nodes can be added to an existing cluster, however it does not affect the
  ownership of shards. Existing nodes can not yet be removed if data is
  present, as shards are not yet being moved to other nodes prior to a removal
  of a node. ([See
  Roadmap](../architecture/roadmap.html)).
