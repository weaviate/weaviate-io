# About this benchmark

This benchmark is designed to measure and illustrate Weaviate's ANN performance for a range of real-life use cases.

ðŸ’¡ this is not a comparative benchmark that runs Weaviate against competing
solutions.

To make the most of this benchmark, you can look at it from different perspectives:

- **The overall performance** â€“ Review the [benchmark result section below](#results) to draw conclusions about what to expect from Weaviate in a production setting.
- **Expectation for your use case** â€“ Find the dataset closest to your production use case, and estimate Weaviate's expected performance for your use case. 
- **Fine Tuning** â€“ If you don't get the results you expect. Find the optimal combinations of the config parameters (efConstruction, maxConnections and ef) to achieve the best results for your production configuration.

## What is being measured?

For each benchmark test, we picked parameters of:
- **efConstruction** - The HNSW build parameter that controls the quality of the
  search at build time.
- **maxConnections**	 - The HNSW build parameter controls how many outgoing
  edges a node can have in the HNSW graph.
- **ef** - The HNSW query time parameter that controls the quality of the search.

For each set of parameters we've run 10000 requests and we measured:

- The **Recall@1**, **Recall@10**, **Recall@100** - by comparing Weaviateâ€™s results to the 
  ground truths specified in each dataset
- **Multi-threaded Queries per Second (QPS)** - The overall throughput you can
  achieve with each configuration
- **Individual Request Latency (mean)** - The mean latency over all 10,000 requests
- **P99 Latency** - 99% of all requests (9.900 out of 10.000) have a latency that
  is lower than or equal to this number â€“ this shows how fast 
- **Import time** - Since varying build parameters has an effect on import
  time, the import time is also included

By request, we mean:
An unfiltered vector search across the entire dataset for the given test. All
latency and throughput results represent the end-to-end time that your
users would also experience. In particular, these means:

* Each request time includes the network overhead for sending the results over the
  wire. In the test setup, the client and server machines were located in the
  same VPC.
* Each request includes retrieving all the matched objects from disk. This is
  a significant difference from `ann-benchmarks`, where the embedded libraries
  only return the matched IDs.

## Benchmark Setup

### Scripts

This benchmark is produced using [open-source
scripts](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-benchmarking), so you can reproduce it yourself.

### Hardware

<img class="image" src="/img/weaviate_benchmark_setup.png" alt="Setup with Weaviate and benchmark machine" />

For the purpose of this benchmark we've used two GCP instances within the same VPC:

* **Benchmark** â€“ a `c2-standard-30` instance with 30 vCPU cores and 120 GB memory â€“ to host Weaviate.
* **Script** â€“ a smaller instance with 8 vCPU â€“ to run benchmarking scripts.

ðŸ’¡ the `c2-standard-30` was chosen for benchmarking for two reasons:

* It is large enough to show that Weaviate is a highly-concurrent vector search
  engine and scales well while running thousands of searches across multiple threads.
* It is small enough to represent a typical production case without inducing
  high costs.

Based on your throughput requirements, it is very likely that you will run Weaviate
on a considerably smaller or larger machine in production.

In [this section below](#what-happens-if-i-run-with-fewer-or-more-cpu-cores-than-on-the-example-test-machine)
we have outlined what you should expect when altering the configuration or
setup parameters.

### Experiment Setup

The selection of datasets is modeled after
[ann-benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks). The same test
queries are used to test speed, throughput, and recall. The provided ground
truths are used to calculate the recall.

The imports were performed using Weaviate's python clients. The concurrent
(multi-threaded) queries were measured using Go. Each language may have a
slightly different performance, and you may experience different results if you
send your queries using another language. For the maximum throughput, we
recommend using the [Go](../client-libraries/go.html) or
[Java](../client-libraries/java.html) clients.

The complete import and test scripts are available [here](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-benchmarking).

# Results

   <h3 class="alert-heading">A guide for picking the right dataset</h3>
   The following results section contains multiple datasets. To get the most of
   this benchmark, pick the dataset that is closest to the use case that
   reflects your data in production based on the following criteria:

   <ul>
     <li><strong>SIFT1M</strong> - A dataset containing 1 million objects of
     128d and using l2 distance metrics. This dataset reflects a common
     use case with a small number of objects.</li>
     <li><strong>Glove-25</strong> - While similar in data size to SIFT1M, each
     vector only has 25 dimensions in this dataset. Because of the smaller
     vectors Weaviate can achieve the highest throghput on this dataset. The
     distance metric used is angular (cosine distance).</li>
     <li><strong>Deep Image 96</strong> - This dataset contains 10 million objects
     at 96d, and is therefore about 10 times as large as SIFT1M. The throughput
     is only slightly lower than that of the SIFT1M. This dataset gives you a
     good indication of expected speeds and throughputs when datasets
     grow.</li>
     <li><strong>GIST 960</strong> - This dataset contains 1 million objects at
     960d.  It has the lowest throughput of the datasets outlined. It
     highlights the cost of vector comparisons with a lot of dimensions. Pick
     this dataset if you run very high-dimensional loads.</li>

   </ul>
</div>

For each dataset, there is a highlighted configuration. The highlighted
configuration is an opinionated pick about a good recall/latency/throughput
trade-off. The highlight sections will give you a good overview of Weaviate's
performance with the respective dataset. Below the highlighted configuration,
you can find alternative configurations.

# Learn more & FAQ

## What is the difference between latency and throughput?

The latency refers to the time it takes to complete a single request. This
is typically measured by taking a mean or percentile distribution of all
requests. For example, a mean latency of 5ms means that a single request takes
on average 5ms to complete. This does not say anything about how many queries
can be answered in a given timeframe.

If Weaviate were single-threaded, the throughput per second would roughly equal
to 1s divided by mean latency. For example, with a mean latency of 5ms, this
would mean that 200 requests can be answered in a second.

However, in reality, you often don't have a single user sending one query after
another. Instead, you have multiple users sending queries. This makes the
querying-side concurrent. Similarly, Weaviate can handle concurrent incoming
requests. We can identify how many concurrent requests can be served by measuring 
the throughput.

We can take our single-thread calculation from before and multiply it with the
number of server CPU cores. This will give us a rough estimate of what the
server can handle concurrently. However, it would be best never to trust this
calculation alone and continuously measure the actual throughput. This is because
such scaling may not always be linear. For example, there may be synchronization 
mechanisms used to make concurrent access safe, such as locks. Not only do
these mechanisms have a cost themselves, but if implemented incorrectly, they
can also lead to congestion which would further decrease the concurrent
throughput. As a result, you cannot perform a single-threaded benchmark and
extrapolate what the numbers would be like in a multi-threaded setting.

All throughput numbers ("QPS") outlined in this benchmark are actual
multi-threaded measurements on a 30-core machine, not estimations.

## What is a p99 latency?

The mean latency gives you an average value of all requests measured. This is a
good indication of how long a user will have to wait on average for
their request to be completed. Based on this mean value, you cannot make any
promises to your users about wait times. 90 out of 100 users might see a
considerably better time, but the remaining 10 might see a significantly worse
time.

To give a more precise indication, percentile-based latencies are used. A
99th-percentile latency - or "p99 latency" for short - indicates the slowest
request that 99% of requests experience. In other words, 99% of your users will
experience a time equal to or better than the stated value. This is a much
better guarantee than a mean value.

In production settings, requirements - as stated in SLAs - are often a
combination of throughput and a percentile latency. For example, the statement
"3000 QPS at p95 latency of 20ms" conveys the following meaning.

- 3000 requests need to be successfully completed per second
- 95% of users must see a latency of 20ms or lower.
- There is no assumption about the remaining 5% of users, implicitly tolerating
  that they will experience higher latencies than 20ms.

The higher the percentile (e.g. p99 over p95) the "safer" the quoted
latency becomes. We have thus decided to use p99-latencies instead of
p95-latencies in our measurements.

## What happens if I run with fewer or more CPU cores than on the example test machine?

The benchmark outlines a QPS per core measurement. This can help you make a
rough estimation of how the throughput would vary on smaller or larger
machines. If you do not need the stated throughput, you can run with fewer CPU
cores. If you need more throughput, you can run with more CPU cores.

Please note that there is a point of diminishing returns with adding more CPUs because of synchronization mechanisms, disk, and memory bottlenecks.â€‹ â€‹Beyond that point, you can scale horizontally instead of vertically. Horizontal scaling with replication will be â€‹[â€‹available in Weaviate soonâ€‹](../architecture/roadmap.html)â€‹.

## What are ef, efConstruction, and maxConnections?

These parameters refer to the [HNSW build and query
parameters](../vector-index-plugins/hnsw.html#how-to-use-hnsw-and-parameters).
They represent a trade-off between recall, latency & throughput, index size, and
memory consumption. This trade-off is highlighted in the benchmark results.

## I can't match the same latencies/throughput in my own setup, how can I debug this?

If you are encountering other numbers in your own dataset, here are a couple of
hints to look at:

* What CPU architecture are you using? The benchmarks above were run on a GCP
  `c2` CPU type, which is based on `amd64` architecture. Weaviate also supports
  `arm64` architecture, but not all optimizations are present. If your machine
  shows maximum CPU usage but you cannot achieve the same throughput, consider
  switching the CPU type to the one used in this benchmark.

* Are you using an actual dataset or random vectors? HNSW is known to perform
  considerably worse with random vectors than with realâ€‹ worldâ€‹ datasets. This is due
  to the distribution of points in real worldâ€‹ datasets compared to randomly
  generated vectors. If you cannot achieve the performance (or recall)
  outlined above with random vectors, switch to an actual dataset.

* Are your disks fast enough? While the ANN search itself is CPU-bound, the objects 
  must be read from disk after the search has been completed. Weaviate
  uses memory-mapped files to speed this process up. However, if not enough
  memory is present or the operating system has allocated the cached pages
  elsewhere, a physical disk read needs to occur. If your disk is slow,
  it could then be that your benchmark is bottlenecked by those disks.

* Are you using more than 2 million vectors? If yes, make sure to set the
  [vector cache large
  enough](../architecture/resources.html#imports-slowed-down-after-crossing-2m-objects---what-can-i-do)
  for maximum performance.
