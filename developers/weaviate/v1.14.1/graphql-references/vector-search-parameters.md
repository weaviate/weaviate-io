# Setting search parameters

Vector search parameters are added to GraphQL queries on the class level.

For example:

{% include code/1.x/graphql.filters.example.html %}

# Built-in parameters

B​uilt in search parameters are available in all Weaviate instances and don't require any modules.​

## NearVector

This filter allows you to find data objects in the vicinity of an input vector. It's supported by the `Get{}` function.

* Note: this argument is different from the [GraphQL `Explore{}` function](explore.html) )
* Note: Cannot use multiple `'near'` arguments, or a `'near'` argument along with an [`'ask'`](../modules/qna-transformers.html) filter

### Variables

| Variables | Mandatory | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vector` | yes | `[float]` | This variable takes a vector embedding in the form of an array of floats. The array should have the same length as the vectors in this class. |
| `distance` | no | `float` | The required degree of similarity between an object's characteristics and the provided filter values. Can't be used together with the `certainty` variable. The interpretation of the value of the distance field depends on the [distance metric used](../vector-index-plugins/distances.html). |
| `certainty` | no | `float` | Normalized Distance between the result item and the search vector. Normalized to be between 0 (identical vectors) and 1 (perfect opposite).. Can't be used together with the `distance` variable. |

### Additional information

If the distance metric is `cosine` you can also use `certainty` instead of
`distance`. Certainty normalizes the distance in a range of 0..1, where 0
reprents a perfect opposite (cosine distance of 2) and 1 represents vectors
with an identical angle (cosine distance of 0). Certainty is not available on
non-cosine distance metrics.

## NearObject

This filter allows you to find data objects in the vicinity of other data objects by UUID. It's supported by the `Get{}` function.

* Note: You cannot use multiple `near<Media>` arguments, or a `near<Media>` argument along with an [`ask`](../modules/qna-transformers.html) argument.
* Note: You can specify an object's `id` or `beacon` in the argument, along with a desired `certainty`.
* Note that the first result will always be the object in the filter itself.
* Near object search can also be combined with `text2vec` modules.

### Variables

| Variables | Mandatory | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | `UUID` | Data object identifier in the uuid format. |
| `beacon` | yes | `url` | Data object identifier in the beacon URL format. E.g., `weaviate://<hostname>/<kind>/id`. |
| `distance` | no | `float` | The required degree of similarity between an object's characteristics and the provided filter values. Can't be used together with the `certainty` variable. The interpretation of the value of the distance field depends on the [distance metric used](../vector-index-plugins/distances.html). |
| `certainty` | no | `float` | Normalized Distance between the result item and the search vector. Normalized to be between 0 (identical vectors) and 1 (perfect opposite).. Can't be used together with the `distance` variable. |

## Group

You can use a group operator to combine similar concepts (aka _entity merging_). There are two ways of grouping objects with a semantic similarity together.

### Variables

| Variables | Mandatory | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | yes | `closest`, `merge` | ​You can only show the closest concept (`closest`) or merge all similar entities into one single string (`merge`). |
| `force` | yes | `url` | The force to apply for a particular movements. Must be between 0 and 1 where 0 is equivalent to no movement and 1 is equivalent to largest movement possible. |

### Example

{% include code/1.x/graphql.filters.group.html %}

{% include molecule-gql-demo.html encoded_query='%7B%0D%0A++Get+%7B%0D%0A++++Publication%28%0D%0A++++++group%3A%7B%0D%0A++++++++type%3A+merge%2C%0D%0A++++++++force%3A0.05%0D%0A++++++%7D%0D%0A++++%29+%7B%0D%0A++++++name%0D%0A++++%7D%0D%0A++%7D%0D%0A%7D' %}

This results in the following. Note that publications `International New York Times`, `The New York Times Company` and `New York Times` are merged. The property values that do not have an exact overlap will all be shown, with the value of the most central concept before the brackets.

| `moveAwayFrom{force}`| no | `float` | The force to apply for a particular movements. Must be between 0 and 1 where 0 is equivalent to no movement and 1 is equivalent to largest movement possible | 
| `distance` | no | `float` | The required degree of similarity between an object's characteristics and the provided filter values. Can't be used together with the `certainty` variable. The interpretation of the value of the distance field depends on the [distance metric used](../vector-index-plugins/distances.html). |
| `certainty` | no | `float` | Normalized Distance between the result item and the search vector. Normalized to be between 0 (identical vectors) and 1 (perfect opposite).. Can't be used together with the `distance` variable. |

### Example I

This example shows a basic overview of using the nearText filter.

### Example II

You can also bias results toward other data objects' vector representations. For example, in this dataset, we have an ambiguous query on our news article dataset, which we bias towards an article called: ["Tohoku: A Japan destination for all seasons."](https://link.semi.technology/3Czhg9p)

{% include code/1.x/graphql.filters.nearText.2obj.html %}

{% include molecule-gql-demo.html encoded_query='%7B%0D%0A++Get%7B%0D%0A++++Article%28%0D%0A++++++nearText%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22traveling+in+Asia%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++++certainty%3A+0.7%2C%0D%0A++++++++moveTo%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++++objects%3A+%5B%7B%0D%0A++++++++++++%23+this+ID+is+of+the+article%3A%0D%0A++++++++++++%23+%22Tohoku%3A+A+Japan+destination+for+all+seasons.%22%0D%0A++++++++++++id%3A+%222faf2b7d-f185-30c0-8c80-a01b7cfeefb4%22%0D%0A++++++++++%7D%5D%0D%0A++++++++++force%3A+0.85%0D%0A++++++++%7D%0D%0A++++++%7D%0D%0A++++%29%7B%0D%0A++++++title%0D%0A++++++summary%0D%0A++++++_additional+%7B%0D%0A++++++++certainty%0D%0A++++++%7D%0D%0A++++%7D%0D%0A++%7D%0D%0A%7D' %}

### Additional information

#### Distance metrics

If the distance metric is `cosine` you can also use `certainty` instead of
`distance`. Certainty normalizes the distance in a range of 0..1, where 0
reprents a perfect opposite (cosine distance of 2) and 1 represents vectors
with an identical angle (cosine distance of 0). Certainty is not available on
non-cosine distance metrics.

#### Concept parsing

Strings written in the concepts array are your fuzzy search terms. An array of concepts is required to set in the Explore query, and all words in this array should be present in the Contextionary.

There are three ways to define the concepts array argument in the filter.

- `["New York Times"]` = one vector position is determined based on the occurrences of the words
- `["New", "York", "Times"]` = all concepts have a similar weight.
- `["New York", "Times"]` = a combination of the two above.

A practical example would be: `concepts: ["beatles", "John Lennon"]`

#### Semantic Path

* Only available in `txt2vec-contextionary` module

The semantic path returns an array of concepts from the query to the data object. This allows you to see which steps Weaviate took and how the query and data object are interpreted. 

| Property | Description |
| `concept` | the concept that is found in this step. |
| `distanceToNext` | the distance to the next step (null for the last step). |
| `distanceToPrevious` | this distance to the previous step (null for the first step). |
| `distanceToQuery` | the distance of this step to the query. |
| `distanceToResult` | the distance of the step to this result. |

_Note: Building a semantic path is only possible if a [`nearText: {}` filter](#neartext) is set as the explore term represents the beginning of the path and each search result represents the end of the path. Since `nearText: {}` queries are currently exclusively possible in GraphQL, the `semanticPath` is therefore not available in the REST API._

Example: showing a semantic path without edges.

{% include code/1.x/graphql.underscoreproperties.semanticpath.html %}

## Ask

Enabled by the module: [Question Answering](../reader-generator-modules/qna-transformers.html).

This filter allows you to return answers to questions by running the results through a Q&A model.

### Variables

| Variables | Mandatory | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `question` 	| yes	| `string` | The question to be answered. 	|
| `certainty` 	| no 	| `float` | Desired minimal certainty or confidence of answer to the question. The higher the value, the stricter the search becomes. The lower the value, the fuzzier the search becomes. If no certainty is set, any answer that could be extracted will be returned|
| `properties` 	| no 	| `[string]` | The properties of the queries Class which contains text. If no properties are set, all are considered.	|
| `rerank` 	| no 	| `boolean`	| If enabled, the qna module will rerank the result based on the answer score. For example, if the 3rd result - as determined by the previous (semantic) search contained the most likely answer, result 3 will be pushed to position 1, etc. *Not supported prior to v1.10.0* |
