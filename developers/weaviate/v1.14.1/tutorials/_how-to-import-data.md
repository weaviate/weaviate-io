# Introduction 

Data is added through the RESTful API. Python and JavaScript clients are available. The syntax of a data object is as follows:

```json
{
  "class": "<class name>",  // as defined during schema creation
  "id": "<UUID>",     // optional, should be in UUID format.
  "properties": {
    "<property name>": "<property value>", // specified in dataType defined during schema creation
  }
}
```

# Prerequisites

 1. **Connect to a Weaviate instance.**\\
 If you haven't set up a Weaviate instance yet, check the [Getting started guide](../getting-started/installation.html). In this guide we assume your instance is running at `http://localhost:8080` with [text2vec-contextionary](../getting-started/installation.html#weaviate-with-the-text2vec-contextionary-model) as vectorization module.
 2. **Upload a schema**. \\
 Learn how to create and upload a schema [here](./how-to-create-a-schema.html). In this guide we assume to have a similar schema uploaded with the classes `Publication`, `Article` and `Author`.

# Add a data object

Let's add a `Publication` with the name `New York Times` to your Weaviate instance. Not all properties have to be filled when adding a data object, so we will skip the `hasArticles` property for now, since we don't have any `Article` objects yet. Note that the `UUID` is given in the `id` parameter now, this is optional.

{% include code/1.x/howto.add.data.things.html %}

# Add a data object with reference

If you want to add data object with a reference in a property, you need to use the `UUID` of the reference data object. Let's add the `Author` named `Jodi Kantor`, who writes for the `New York Times`:

{% include code/1.x/howto.add.data.things.reference.html %}

You can also add references later, when the data object is already created. The following example first creates the `Author` with `name`, and later adds the reference to a `Publication`. This comes in handy when you need to create data objects first before you can add references.

{% include code/1.x/howto.add.data.things.add.reference.html %}

# Next steps

- Take a look at [How to query data](./how-to-query-data.html) to learn how to interact with the data you just added.
- See the RESTful [API reference pages](../restful-api-references/index.html) for all API operations to add, modify and delete data.
