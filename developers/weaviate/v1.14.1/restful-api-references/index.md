# RESTful API

Weaviate has a basic RESTful API which will be used to offer CRUD support on all data objects. The clients automatically determine if they should call the RESTful or GraphQL-API. You can also choose to call the APIs themselves.

## Open API specs

The Open API specs for the current Weaviate version number can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/semi-technologies/weaviate/{{ site.weaviate_version }}).
