## Overview

Tutorials aim to empower you to use Weaviate based on *your* particular needs.

<!-- By the time you are done, you will have seen a number of examples and considerations in organizing and importing your data into Weaviate. You will have learnt everything from rules of thumb for selecting a vectorizer, all the way through to how to perform CRUD operations with Weaviate. -->

import BasicPrereqs from '/_includes/prerequisites-quickstart.md';

<BasicPrereqs />

Here, you can learn how to:

<!-- - [Select the right vectorizer]  (./_select-vectorizer.md): Identify the right vectorizer based on your data type (text, image, etc.) and application goals (text clustering, Q&A, text to image comparison, image comparison). -->
- [Define a schema](../starter-guides/schema.md)
- [Import data](./import.md)
- [Query data](./query.md)
- [Add modules with Weaviate](./modules.md)
- [Use the Weaviate console](/developers/wcs/platform/console.mdx)
<!-- - [Perform CRUD operations]  (./_crud.md): Perform CRUD operations with Weaviate. -->
- [Spark Connector](./spark-connector.md): Loading data into Weaviate using Spark.
<!-- Once you are finished with this section, we suggest moving on to our [Search tutorials]  (../_search/index.md). There we guide you through the powerful yet flexible options Weaviate provides for searching through your data.  -->
