When working with a database, you want [full CRUD support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). Not all approximate nearest neighbor algorithms support this, and not all incumbent databases (or search engines) are optimized for this type of indexing. These reasons are -among others- the most important to why Weaviate exists. You can also learn more about this by reading [this blog post](https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/87).
