## Overview

Learn how to connect to Weaviate. Configure your connection to provide authentication parameters and API keys for Weaviate and third-party API services like Cohere, Hugging Face and OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

To configure a connection, you need the following information:

- The location of your Weaviate instance
- If authentication is enabled, the allowed authentication methods
- If you are using modules, the API keys and module connection details

### Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)

The Weaviate Cloud Services dashboard has the cluster URL, authentication status, and enabled modules details.

### Docker and Kubernetes

Your container configuration files include connection details. 

- For Docker Compose, see `docker-compose.yml`.
- For Kubernetes, see `values.yaml` in the Helm chart.

Docker instances often use the `http://localhost:8080` address.

### Embedded Weaviate
If you are using Embedded Weaviate, you do not need to specify a URL when you create the client. Embedded instances usually don't need authentication details. For details, see the [Embedded Weaviate documentation](../installation/embedded.md).

## Connecting to Weaviate

### Without authentication

:::warning Use authentication
Do not expose your Weaviate instance to the public internet if authentication is not enabled. If you do not enable authentication, anyone who has the URL can access your Weaviate instance.
:::

<WCSWithoutAuthentication/>

## With authentication enabled

If authentication is enabled, use a Weaviate API key or OIDC to connect.

### Use a Weaviate API key

Edit the sample code to use your Weaviate API key. Be sure to use your Weaviate API key and not the API key for a third-party service like Cohere, Hugging Face, or OpenAI.

<WCSAuthenticationApiKey/>

### Use OIDC 

WCS username & password

:::note Shown setup is for WCS
This authentication method is available for WCS. Your specific identity provider may use a different authentication configuration, of which there are many.

- Read more about [OIDC authentication](../configuration/authentication.md#oidc---a-systems-perspective).
:::

<WCSAuthenticationUserPass/>

## Providing inference API keys

Additionally, you can provide inference API keys to Weaviate so that you can use modules that leverage external APIs, for example `generative-openai` or `text2vec-cohere`.

This is done via an additional header, added as below:
