## Overview

:::info This video covers options for adding a vector during import.
:::

When importing objects into Weaviate, you can choose to:
- **Provide object vectors** to Weaviate,
- **Configure a vectorizer** to obtain vectors at import time, or
- **Combine these options** to configure a vectorizer while explicitly providing vectors.

This **5-minute video** provides an overview of all three workflows, with code examples shown in Python.

### Prerequisites

We recommend that you go through the [Quickstart tutorial](../quickstart/index.md) before watching this video, or to make sure you are familiar with the basic of a schema, import, and query in Weaviate.
