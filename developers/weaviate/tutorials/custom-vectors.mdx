As a [vector database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database), Weaviate operates using vector representations, also known as "embeddings", of data objects.

To generate these vector embeddings, you can employ a Weaviate ["vectorizer" module](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/index.md), which can generate vectors at the time of import. Alternatively, you're welcome to supply your own "custom" vector embeddings.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of using Weaviate with your own vectors.

If you choose to specify your own vector embeddings, performing a vector search with Weaviate looks like this:

1. Create a Weaviate instance
2. Connect to the Weaviate instance
3. Import your data, specifying your own vectors
4. Perform a vector search with Weaviate


## Data

We'll use as an example a tiny dataset consisting of 10 questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!". Each object has an associated vector embedding.

In this example, these vectors were obtained through an OpenAI API, using the <nobr>[`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)</nobr>. But your vectors can come from any source, such as another inference service provider (e.g Cohere or Hugging Face) or your own fine-tuned model.

## Installation

Weaviate is open source and you can easily [run the binary on Linux](../installation/embedded.md) or [run a local instance from a Docker image](../installation/docker-compose.md) on any OS, or even easier - you can create a free sandbox instance with the [Weaviate Cloud Services](../../wcs/quickstart.mdx) (WCS).

For this example, we will assume that you are using a WCS instance with authentication enabled.


## Client library

For the best experience with Weaviate, we recommend installing a Weaviate client library for one of these languages:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart/clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

For JavaScript/TypeScript, we'll also need the `node-fetch` library to download the dataset, so make sure to `npm install node-fetch`.


## Authentication

The recommended way to [authenticate](../configuration/authentication.md) to WCS is with an API key. Once the instance is ready, click on its <kbd>Details</kbd> button, then the key <kbd>ðŸ”‘</kbd> icon to access the API key:

import WCSGetKey from '../../wcs/guides/img/wcs-get-key.png';

<img src={WCSGetKey} width="100%" alt="Instance configuration"/>

Grab the "Admin" key. You'll need it later for the client instantiation, which looks like this:

import WCSAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.api.key.mdx';

<WCSAuthenticationApiKey/>


## Schema

Weaviate [stores data](../concepts/data.md) objects in collections, each of which is called a `class`. Each object has a set of properties, and a vector representation generated automatically by a vectorizer, or specified at import time.

Weaviate lets you define vectorizers at the class level, with further control (e.g. specific model, or vectorization behavior) at the property level. Since you're bringing your own vectors, a vectorizer is not needed, so we will set `vectorizer: "none"` in the class here.

:::note Optional: Set a **compatible** vectorizer
If you're using "custom" vectors that utilize the same model available through a Weaviate module, you have the option to **designate that specific model and module** as the class vectorizer.<p><br/></p>

In this tutorial, the vectors were produced using the OpenAI model `ada-002`. As this model is also available through the `text2vec-openai` module, it may be set as the class vectorizer. Doing so will enable Weaviate to generate vectors if any objects are upserted without a vector, and enable the [`nearText` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#neartext).<p><br/></p>

Note that if a class has a specified vectorizer but you provide a vector at the time of import, Weaviate will use your supplied vector.

import CreateSchema from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.schema.mdx'

<CreateSchema />


## Import data with vectors

Here is the set of [10 pre-vectorized Jeopardy questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny+vectors.json) in JSON format.

The following will load the question objects with vectors, and import them to Weaviate.

Note that we use a batch import process, so that each request to the inference API contains multiple objects. You should use batch imports unless you have a good reason not to, as it will significantly improve the speed of data ingestion.

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

<ImportQuestionsWithVectors />


## Query

Let's say you want to find questions related to biology. We can do that by obtaining a vector embedding for "biology", and finding objects nearest to it.
In this example, we've used the OpenAI API to generate it, with the same [`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings). Then, in the following query, we pass that vector to the [`nearVector` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#nearvector):

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart/response.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />


## Putting it together

The following code puts it all together, taking care of everything from schema definition to data import to query. Remember to replace the endpoint and Weaviate key.

import ByovAll from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.all.mdx'

<ByovAll />


## Recap

If you made it here - well done. We have covered a lot, and you've successfully built a fully functioning vector database! ðŸ¥³

You have:
- Populated your Weaviate instance with your own vectors, and
- Performed text similarity searches.

Of course, there is a lot more to Weaviate that we have not yet covered, and probably a lot that you wish to know about. So we include a few links below that might help you to get started in your journey with us.
