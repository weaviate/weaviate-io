**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a powerful security mechanism that lets you manage who can access and modify your Weaviate instance. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up RBAC in Weaviate by defining roles with tailored permissions and assigning them to users. This enables granular control over operations—from reading and writing data to managing collections and tenants—ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

## Introduction

In the steps that follow, we’ll cover:

- **Step 1: Connecting to Weaviate**  
  Ensure you're authenticated with a user who has the necessary role management permissions.
- **Step 2: Creating custom roles**  
  Define roles with precise permissions tailored for various access levels, such as read/write, viewer, or tenant management.
- **Step 3: Assigning roles to users**  
  Apply these roles to users, effectively controlling their access across different resources.

    end

    subgraph sg3 ["3. Assign the role to a user"]
        C1
    end

    %% Style nodes with white background and darker borders
    style A1 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#B9C8DF,color:#130C49
    style B1 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#B9C8DF,color:#130C49
    style B2 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#B9C8DF,color:#130C49
    style C1 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#B9C8DF,color:#130C49

    %% Style subgraphs with brand colors
    style sg1 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#61BD73,stroke-width:2px,color:#130C49
    style sg2 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#130C49,stroke-width:2px,color:#130C49
    style sg3 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#7AD6EB,stroke-width:2px,color:#130C49
```

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a clear roadmap for implementing RBAC in your Weaviate deployment, adding an essential layer of security to your AI powered applications.

We are going to create the following roles:
- **[Read and write permissions](#read-and-write-permissions):** `rw_role`  
  Learn how to create a custom role that grants read and write access to collections and data, and assign it to a user.
- **[Viewer permissions](#viewer-permissions):** `viewer_role`  
  Set up a role that restricts users to read-only access for specific collections.
- **[Tenant permissions](#tenant-permissions):** `tenant_manager`  
  Configure roles with permissions to manage tenants, including creating, reading, and updating tenant information.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Docker for running a Weaviate instance locally.
- Your preferred Weaviate [client library](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries) installed.

### Local instance - `root` user

In order to follow the rest of the tutorial we will need to connect to Weaviate with a user who has the `root` role assigned. This will allow us to manage roles and permissions.

Create a Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) and copy the following configuration:

```yaml
---
services:
  weaviate:
    command:
    - --host
    - 0.0.0.0
    - --port
    - '8080'
    - --scheme
    - http
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    - 50051:50051
    volumes:
    - weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate
    restart: on-failure:0
    environment:
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
      ENABLE_API_BASED_MODULES: 'true'
      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'false'
      AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ENABLED: 'true'
      AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ALLOWED_KEYS: 'user-a-key,user-b-key'
      AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_USERS: 'user-a,user-b'
      AUTHORIZATION_ENABLE_RBAC: 'true'
      AUTHORIZATION_RBAC_ROOT_USERS: 'user-a'
volumes:
  weaviate_data:
...
```

The environment variables in this configuration:
- Enable RBAC.
- Configure `user-a` as a user with built-in root/admin permissions.
- Configure `user-b` as a user with no built-in permissions.

We will connect to Weaviate with `user-a`, and once we create a new role, we will assign it to `user-b`.

## Read and write permissions

### Step 1: Connect to Weaviate

Ensure you are connected to Weaviate with a user possessing sufficient permissions to manage roles. You can achieve this by either using the predefined `root` role during [Weaviate configuration](/developers/weaviate/configuration/rbac/configuration) or by granting a user the [`manage_roles` permission](/developers/weaviate/configuration/rbac/manage-roles-users#role-management-permissions).
