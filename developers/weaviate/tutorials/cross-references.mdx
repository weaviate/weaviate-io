## Overview

Many applications require the ability to manage relationships between objects. For example, a blog application might need to store information about the author of each post. Or, a document store may chunk documents into smaller pieces and store them in separate objects, each with a reference to the original document.

In Weaviate, you can use cross-references to manage relationships between objects. Cross-references are a special type of property that can be used to link objects together. In the above examples, each blog post could have a cross-reference property called `hasAuthor` to link each post to its author, or each chunk could have a cross-reference property called `sourceDocument` to link each chunk to its original document.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use cross-references to manage relationships between objects, and to use them to enhance your search queries.

We will refer to the originating object as the **source** object, and the object that is being linked to (cross-referenced object) as the **target** object.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the [QuickStart tutorial](../quickstart/index.md) and have access to a Weaviate instance with write access.

## When to use cross-references

Cross-references are useful when you need to establish relationships between objects in Weaviate. For example, you might want to link:

- A blog post (source) to its author (target).
- A document chunk (source) to its original document (target).
- A product (source) to its manufacturer (target).

In each of these cases, you can use a cross-reference property to link the objects together.

## How cross-references work

In Weaviate, cross-reference relationships are defined as class properties. Each of these properties is characterized by a name and a data type. Each cross-reference property can be directed to one or more target classes. For example, a `hasAuthor` cross-reference property might be directed to the `Author` class, while a `sourceDocument` cross-reference property might be directed to the `Document` class.

Cross-references are uni-directional; to establish a bi-directional relationship, two distinct cross-reference properties are required, facilitating linkage in both directions.

### Cross references and vectors

Linking objects with cross-references does not affect the vectorization of the objects. For example, if you link a blog post to its author, the vector of the blog post object will not include, or be affected by, the vector of the author object.

## Managing cross-references

Each cross-reference can be created, updated, and deleted independently of the objects that it links. This allows you to manage relationships between objects without having to modify the objects themselves.

To create a cross-reference, you must include the cross-reference property in the source class, and then add the cross-reference to the source object.

### Include a cross-reference property

A cross-reference property must be included in the class definition. For example, to create a `hasAuthor` cross-reference property in the `BlogPost` class, you would include the following in the class definition:

```json
{
    "class": "BlogPost",
    "properties": [
        ...  // other class properties
        // highlight-start
        {
            "name": "hasAuthor",
            "dataType": ["Author"],
        },
        // highlight-end
    ],
    ...  // other class attributes (e.g. vectorizer)
}
```

### Create a cross-reference

To create a cross-reference, Weaviate requires the following information:

- The class and UUID of the source (from) object.
- The class and UUID of the target (to) object.
- The name of the cross-reference property.

## Queries with cross-references

Once you have established cross-references between objects, you can use them to enhance your search queries. For example, you can use cross-references to:

- Retrieve properties of target objects.
- Filter objects based on properties of target objects.

### Retrieve properties of a target object

You can retrieve properties of a target object just as you would retrieve properties of the source object.

For example, where a document chunk includes a cross-reference to its original document, you can use the cross-reference to retrieve properties of the original document. Accordingly, you can retrieve the title of the document or the author of the document, just as you would retrieve a property of the chunk itself such as the text of the chunk.

### Filter using cross-references

You can configure a filter to include or exclude objects based on properties of the target object.

For example, you can filter articles based on an attribute of the author, such as the author's name or the author's location.

#### Two-stage queries

Because cross-references do not affect vectors, you cannot use vector searches to filter objects based on properties of the target object.

However, you can use a two-stage query to achieve a similar result. In this example, we will use a first query to search the target class, and then use the results of that query to filter the source class.
