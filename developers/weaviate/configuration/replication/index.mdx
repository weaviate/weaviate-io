Weaviate instances can be replicated. Replication can improve read throughput, improve availability, and enable zero-downtime upgrades.

For more details on how replication is designed and built in Weaviate, see [Replication Architecture](../concepts/replication-architecture/index.md).

## How to configure

import RaftRFChangeWarning from '/\_includes/1-25-replication-factor.mdx';

<RaftRFChangeWarning/>

Replication is disabled by default. It can be enabled per collection in the [collection configuration](../manage-data/collections.mdx#replication-settings). This means you can set different replication factors per class in your dataset.

To enable replication, you can set one or both of the following:

- `REPLICATION_MINIMUM_FACTOR` environment variable for the entire Weaviate instance, or
- `replicationFactor` parameter for a collection.

### Weaviate-wide minimum replication factor

The `REPLICATION_MINIMUM_FACTOR` environment variable sets the minimum replication factor for all collections in the Weaviate instance.

If you set the [replication factor for a collection](#replication-factor-for-a-collection), the collection's replication factor overrides the minimum replication factor.

### Replication factor for a collection

import SchemaReplication from '/\_includes/code/schema.things.create.replication.mdx';

<SchemaReplication/>

In this example, there are three replicas. If you set the replication factor before you import data, all of the data is replicated three times.

The replication factor can be modified after you add data to a collection. If you modify the replication factor afterwards, new data is copied across the new and pre-existing replica nodes.

The example data schema has a [write consistency](../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#tunable-write-consistency) level of `ALL`. When you upload or update a schema, the changes are sent to `ALL` nodes (via a coordinator node). The coordinator node waits for a successful acknowledgment from `ALL` nodes before sending a success message back to the client. This ensures a highly consistent schema in your distributed Weaviate setup.

## Data consistency

When Weaviate detects inconsistent data across nodes, it attempts to repair the out of sync data.

Starting in v1.26, Weaviate adds [async replication](../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#async-replication) to proactively detect inconsistencies. In earlier versions, Weaviate uses a [repair-on-read](../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#repair-on-read) strategy to repair inconsistencies at read time.

Repair-on-read is automatic. To activate async replication, set `asyncEnabled` to true in the `replicationConfig` section of your collection definition.

import ReplicationConfigWithAsyncRepair from '/\_includes/code/configuration/replication-consistency.mdx';

<ReplicationConfigWithAsyncRepair />

### Configure async replication settings {#async-replication-settings}

:::info Added in `v1.29`
The [environment variables](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars#async-replication) for configuring async replication (`ASYNC_*`) have been introduced in `v1.29`.
:::

Async replication helps achieve consistency for data replicated across multiple nodes.

Update the following [environment variables](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars#async-replication) to configure async replication for your particular use case.

#### Logging

- **Set the frequency of the logger:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_LOGGING_FREQUENCY`
  Define how often the async replication background process will log events.

#### Data comparison

- **Set the frequency of comparisons:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_FREQUENCY`
  Define how often each node compares its local data with other nodes.
- **Set comparison timeout:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_DIFF_PER_NODE_TIMEOUT`
  Optionally configure a timeout for how long to wait during comparison when a node is unresponsive.
- **Monitor node availability:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_ALIVE_NODES_CHECKING_FREQUENCY`
  Trigger comparisons whenever there’s a change in node availability.
- **Configure hash tree height:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_HASHTREE_HEIGHT`
  Specify the size of the hash tree, which helps narrow down data differences by comparing hash digests at multiple levels instead of scanning entire datasets. See [this page](../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#memory-and-performance-considerations-for-async-replication) for more information on the memory and performance considerations for async replication.
- **Batch size for digest comparison:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_DIFF_BATCH_SIZE`
  Define the number of objects whose digest (e.g., last update time) is compared between nodes before propagating actual objects.

#### Data synchronization

Once differences between nodes are detected, Weaviate propagates outdated or missing data. Configure synchronization as follows:

- **Set the frequency of propagation:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_FREQUENCY_WHILE_PROPAGATING`
  After synchronization is completed on a node, temporarily adjust the data comparison frequency to the set value.
- **Set propagation timeout:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_TIMEOUT`
  Optionally configure a timeout for how long to wait during propagation when a node is unresponsive.
- **Set propagation delay:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_DELAY`
  Define a delay period to allow asynchronous write operations to reach all nodes before propagating new or updated objects.
- **Batch size for data propagation:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_BATCH_SIZE`
  Define the number of objects that are sent in each synchronization batch during the propagation phase.
- **Set propagation limits:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_LIMIT`
  Enforce a limit on the number of out-of-sync objects to be propagated per replication iteration.
- **Set propagation concurrency:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_CONCURRENCY`
  Specify the number of concurrent workers that can send batches of objects to other nodes, allowing multiple propagation batches to be sent simultaneously.

:::tip
Tweak these settings based on your cluster size and network latency to achieve optimal performance. Smaller batch sizes and shorter timeouts may be beneficial for high-traffic clusters, while larger clusters might require more conservative settings.

## How to use: Queries

When you add (write) or query (read) data, one or more replica nodes in the cluster will respond to the request. How many nodes need to send a successful response and acknowledgment to the coordinator node depends on the `consistency_level`. Available [consistency levels](../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md) are `ONE`, `QUORUM` (replication_factor / 2 + 1) and `ALL`.

The `consistency_level` can be specified at query time:

```bash
# Get an object by ID, with consistency level ONE
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/objects/{ClassName}/{id}?consistency_level=ONE"
```

:::note
In v1.17, only [read queries that get data by ID](../manage-data/read.mdx#get-an-object-by-id) had a tunable consistency level. All other object-specific REST endpoints (read or write) used the consistency level `ALL`. Starting with v1.18, all write and read queries are tunable to either `ONE`, `QUORUM` (default) or `ALL`. GraphQL endpoints use the consistency level `ONE` (in both versions).

import QueryReplication from '/\_includes/code/replication.get.object.by.id.mdx';

<QueryReplication/>

## Replica movement and status

:::caution Do not use in production

Available starting in `v1.31`. This is an experimental feature and shouldn't be used in a production environment for now.

:::

Beyond setting the initial replication factor, you can actively manage the placement of shard replicas within your Weaviate cluster. This is useful for rebalancing data after scaling, decommissioning nodes, or optimizing data locality. Replica movement is managed through a set of dedicated [RESTful API endpoints](../../api/rest.md#tag/replication) or [programmatically through client libraries](./replica-movement.mdx).
