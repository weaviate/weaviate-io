Looking for vectorizer, generative AI, or reranker integration docs?

You may be looking for documentation for how to use Weaviate with popular model providers, such as [Anthropic](../model-providers/anthropic/index.md), [AWS](../model-providers/aws/index.md), [Cohere](../model-providers/cohere/index.md), [Hugging Face](../model-providers/huggingface/index.md), [Ollama](../model-providers/ollama/index.md) or [OpenAI](../model-providers/openai/index.md).

They have moved to our [model provider integrations](../model-providers/index.md) section, for a more focussed, user-centric look at these integrations.
