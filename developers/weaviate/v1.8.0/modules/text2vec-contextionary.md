# Introduction

The module `text2vec-contextionary` is Weaviate's own language vectorizer. It gives context to the language used in your dataset (there are Contextionary versions available for multiple languages). The Contextionary is a Weighted Mean of Word Embeddings (WMOWE) vectorizer module which works with popular models such as fastText and GloVe. The most recent `text2vec-contextionary` is trained using [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) on Wiki and CommonCrawl data. We aim to make the Contextionary available for use cases in any domain, regardless if they are business-related, academic or other. But you can also [create your own vectorizer](./custom-modules.html) if desired.

The `text2vec-contextionary` places data into a 300-dimensional space. Each datapoint will thus have a vector of 300 numbers. This vector is computed from the pre-trained Contextionary (you never have to do any training yourself), that contains the contextual representation that allows Weaviate to store data based on its contextual meaning. An empty Weaviate with the preloaded `text2vec-contextionary` module, could be envisioned like this (in a simplified 3D visualization):

When you add data, the Contextionary calculates the position in the vector space that represents the real-world entity.

The process from a data object to a vector position is calculated based on the centroid of the words weighted by the occurrences of the individual words in the original training text-corpus (e.g., the word `"has"` is seen as less important than the word `"apples"`).

When a new class object is created, it will be added to a Weaviate.

# How to use

## Module configuration


### Docker-compose

Which modules to use in a Weaviate instance can be specified in the docker-compose configuration file. The service can be added like this

```yaml
---
version: '3.4'
services:
  weaviate:
    command:
    - --host
    - 0.0.0.0
    - --port
    - '8080'
    - --scheme
    - http
    image: semitechnologies/weaviate:1.8.0
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    restart: on-failure:0
    environment:
      CONTEXTIONARY_URL: contextionary:9999
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: 'text2vec-contextionary'
      ENABLE_MODULES: 'text2vec-contextionary'
  contextionary:
    environment:
      OCCURRENCE_WEIGHT_LINEAR_FACTOR: 0.75
      EXTENSIONS_STORAGE_MODE: weaviate
      EXTENSIONS_STORAGE_ORIGIN: http://weaviate:8080
      NEIGHBOR_OCCURRENCE_IGNORE_PERCENTILE: 5
      ENABLE_COMPOUND_SPLITTING: 'false'
    image: semitechnologies/contextionary:en0.16.0-v1.0.2
    ports:
    - 9999:9999
...
```

Variable explanations:
* `EXTENSIONS_STORAGE_MODE`: where custom extensions to the contextionary are stored
* `EXTENSIONS_STORAGE_ORIGIN`: the host of the custom extension storage
* `NEIGHBOR_OCCURRENCE_IGNORE_PERCENTILE`: this can be used to hide very rare words. If you set it 5 that means the 5th percentile of words by occurrence are removed in the nearestNeighbor search (for example used in the GraphQL `_additional { nearestNeighbors }` feature).
* `ENABLE_COMPOUND_SPLITTING`: see [here](#compound-splitting).

_Note: at the moment, text vectorization modules cannot be combined in a single setup. This means that you can either enable the `text2vec-contextionary`, the `text2vec-transformers` or no text vectorization module._

### Default vectorizer module

Unless you specify a default vectorization module in Weaviate's configuration, you'll need to specify which vectorization module is used per class you add to the data schema (or you need to enter a vector for each data point you add manually). Set the default with the environment variable `DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE` to `text2vec-contextionary` in the docker-compose configuration file: 

``` yaml
services:
  weaviate:
    environment:
      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: text2vec-contextionary
```

## Per-class configuration

To indicate the a data class should use the `text2vec-contextionary` as vectorizer, you need to specify this per class in the [data schema](../data-schema/schema-configuration.html). 

Example of a class [configured to use `text2vec-contextionary` in your data schema](../data-schema/schema-configuration.html): 
```json
{
  "class": "Article",
  "description": "A piece of text containing news",
  "properties": [ 
    {
      "name": "title",
      "description": "The caption of the article",
      "dataType": ["string"]
    }
  ],
  "vectorizer": "text2vec-contextionary",
  "moduleConfig": {
    "text2vec-contextionary": {  
      "vectorizeClassName": true            # default is true
    }
  }
}
```

* If `"vectorizeClassName"` is set to `true`, the name of the class (`"Article"`) in the example, is used in the calculation for the vector position of each data object that will be added. More info [here](#regulate-semantic-indexing).

### text2vec-contextionary as default vectorizer

The `text2vec-contextionary` can be set as default vectorizer module with the environment variable `DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE`:
- `DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE="text2vec-contextionary"`
Each class that is added to the data schema will then use the `text2vec-contextionary` module as vectorizer unless an explicit other module (or `"none"`) is specified in the [schema](../data-schema/schema-configuration.html#vectorizer). 

## Per-property configuration

There is also configuration per property, to [regulate the semantic indexing](#regulate-semantic-indexing) of the property name and value. For example the following property could be part of a class in the data schema.

```json
    {
      "name": "summary",
      "description": "The most important content of the article in short",
      "dataType": ["text"],
      "moduleConfig": {
        "text2vec-contextionary": {
          "skip": true,                    # default is false
          "vectorizePropertyName": true,   # default is false
        }
      }
    }
```

* If `"vectorizePropertyName"` is set to `true`, the name of the property (`"summary"`) in the example, is used in the calculation for the vector position of each data object that will be added. More info [here](#regulate-semantic-indexing).
* if `"skip"` is set to `true`, the whole property (both name and value) will be ignored for vectorization.


# Module endpoints (API Reference)
The `text2vec-contextionary` module has two RESTful endpoints.

## Find concepts: `/v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/concepts`

To find concepts or words or to check if a concept is part of the Contextionary, , use the `v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/concepts/<concept>` endpoint. 

```js
GET /v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/concepts/<concept>
```

### Parameters 

The only parameter `concept` is a string that should be camelCased in case of compound words or a list of words.

### Response

The result contains the following fields:
- `"individualWords"`: a list of the results of individual words or concepts in the query, which contains:
  - `"word"`: a string of requested concept or single word from the concept.
  - `"present"`: a boolean value which is `true` if the word exists in the Contextionary.
  - `"info"`: an object with the following fields:
    - `""nearestNeighbors"`: a list with the nearest neighbors, containing `"word"` and `"distance"` (between the two words in the high dimensional space). Note that `"word"` can also be a data object.
    - `"vector"`: the raw 300-long vector value.
  - `"concatenatedWord"`: an object of the concatenated concept.
    - `"concatenatedWord"`: the concatenated word if the concept given is a camelCased word.
      - `"singleWords"`: a list of the single words in the concatenated concept.
      - `"concatenatedVector"`: a list of vector values of the concatenated concept.
      - `"concatenatedNearestNeighbors"`: a list with the nearest neighbors, containing `"word"` and `"distance"` (between the two words in the high dimensional space). Note that `"word"` can also be a data object.

### Example

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/concepts/magazine
```

or (note the camelCased compound concept)

{% include code/1.x/contextionary.get.html %}

with a result similar to:

```json

## Extending the Contextionary: `/v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/extensions` 

Custom words or abbreviations (i.e., "concepts") can be added to Weaviate directly by extending the Contextionary. Using this endpoint will enrich the Contextionary with your own words, abbreviations or concepts in context by [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). Using the `v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/extensions/` endpoint teaches Weaviate the new concepts real-time. You can also overwrite concepts with this endpoint. Note that you need to learn Weaviate the new concepts before adding data.

### Parameters
A body (in JSON or YAML) with the extension word or abbreviation you want to add to the Contextionary with the following fields:
- `"concept"`: a string with the word, compound word or abbreviation
- `"definition"`: a clear description of the concept, which will be used to create the context of the concept and place it in the high dimensional Contextionary space.
- `"weight"`: a float with the relative weight of the concept (default concepts in the Contextionary have a weight of 1.0)

### Response
The same fields as the input parameters will be in the response body if the extension was successful.


### Example
Let's add the concept `"weaviate"` to the Contextionary. 

{% include code/1.x/contextionary.extensions.html %}

You can always check if the new concept exists in the Contextionary:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/concepts/weaviate
```

Note that it is not (yet) possible to extend the Contextionary with concatenated words or concepts consisting of more than one word.

You can also overwrite current concepts with this endpoint. Let's say you are using the abbreviation `API` for `Academic Performance Index` instead of `Application Programming Interface`, and you want to reposition this concept in the Contextionary:

```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "concept": "api",
    "definition": "Academic Performance Index a measurement of academic performance and progress of individual schools in California",
    "weight": 1
  }' \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/modules/text2vec-contextionary/extensions
```

The meaning of the concept `API` has now changed in your Weaviate setting.

# Additional GraphQL API filters

## nearText

The `text2vec-contextionary` vectorizer module adds one filter for `Get {}` and `Explore {}` GraphQL functions: `nearText: {}`. This filter can be used for semantically searching text in your dataset. 

Note: Cannot use multiple `'near'` filters, or a `'near'` filter along with an [`'ask'`](./qna-transformers.html) filter!

### Example GraphQL Get(nearText{}) filter

{% include code/1.x/graphql.filters.nearText.html %}

{% include molecule-gql-demo.html encoded_query='%7B%0D%0A++Get%7B%0D%0A++++Publication%28%0D%0A++++++nearText%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22fashion%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++++certainty%3A+0.7%2C%0D%0A++++++++moveAwayFrom%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22finance%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++++++force%3A+0.45%0D%0A++++++++%7D%2C%0D%0A++++++++moveTo%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22haute+couture%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++++++force%3A+0.85%0D%0A++++++++%7D%0D%0A++++++%7D%0D%0A++++%29%7B%0D%0A++++++name%0D%0A++++++_additional+%7B%0D%0A++++++++certainty%0D%0A++++++%7D%0D%0A++++%7D%0D%0A++%7D%0D%0A%7D' %}

### Example GraphQL Explore(nearText{}) filter

{% include code/1.x/graphql.explore.simple.html %}

{% include molecule-gql-demo.html encoded_query='%7B%0D%0A++Explore+%28%0D%0A++++nearText%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22New+Yorker%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++certainty%3A+0.95%2C%0D%0A++++++moveAwayFrom%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22fashion%22%2C+%22shop%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++++force%3A+0.2%0D%0A++++++%7D%0D%0A++++++moveTo%3A+%7B%0D%0A++++++++concepts%3A+%5B%22publisher%22%2C+%22articles%22%5D%2C%0D%0A++++++++force%3A+0.5%0D%0A++++++%7D%2C%0D%0A++++%7D%0D%0A++%29+%7B%0D%0A++++beacon%0D%0A++++certainty%0D%0A++++className%0D%0A++%7D%0D%0A%7D' %}

### CamelCase interpretation

Weaviate's vectorization module `text2vec-contextionary` splits words based on CamelCase. For example, if a user wants to explore for the iPhone (the Apple device) they should use `iphone` rather than `iPhone` because the latter will be interpreted as `[i, phone]`.

### Concepts

Strings written in the `Concepts` array are your fuzzy search terms. An array of concepts is required to set in the Explore query, and all words in this array should be present in the Contextionary.

There are three ways to define the `concepts` array argument in the Explore filter.

- `["New York Times"]` = one vector position is determined based on the occurrences of the words
- `["New", "York", "Times"]` = all concepts have a similar weight.
- `["New York", "Times"]` = a combination of the two above.

A practical example would be: `concepts: ["beatles", "John Lennon"]`

### Certainty

You can set a minimum required `certainty`, which will be used to determine which data results to return. The value is a float between 0.0 (return all data objects, regardless similarity) and 1.0 (only return data objects that are matching completely, without any uncertainty). The certainty of a query result is computed by normalized distance of the fuzzy query and the data object in the vector space.

### Moving

Because pagination is not possible in multidimensional storage, you can improve your results with additional explore functions which can move away from semantic concepts or towards semantic concepts. E.g., if you look for the concept 'New York Times' but don't want to find the city New York, you can use the `moveAwayFrom{}` function by using the words 'New York'. This is also a way to exclude concepts and to deal with negations (`not` operators in similar query languages). Concepts in the `moveAwayFrom{}` filter are not per definition excluded from the result, but the resulting concepts are further away from the concepts in this filter.

Moving can be done based on `concepts` and/or `objects`. 
* `concepts` requires a list of one or more words
* `objects` requires a list of one or more objects, given by their `id` or `beacon`. For example:

```graphql
{
  Get{
    Publication(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["fashion"],
        certainty: 0.7,
        moveTo: {
            objects: [{
                beacon: "weaviate://localhost/e5dc4a4c-ef0f-3aed-89a3-a73435c6bbcf"
            }, {
                id: "9f0c7463-8633-30ff-99e9-fd84349018f5" 
            }],
            concepts: ["summer"],
            force: 0.9
        }
      }
    ){
      name
      _additional {
        certainty
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Additional GraphQL API properties

The `text2vec-contextionary` vectorizer module extends the `additional` properties in the [GraphQL](../graphql-references/additional-properties.html) and [RESTful](../restful-api-references/objects.html#get-a-data-object) API. 

## Interpretation

When Weaviate vectorizes your data-object, it normalizes the data so that the contextionary can interpret it. With the additional property `interpretation` you can request how Weaviate indexed your data-object.

{% include code/1.x/graphql.underscoreproperties.interpretation.html %}

## Semantic Path

The semantic path returns an array of concepts from the query to the data object. This allows you to see which steps Weaviate took and how the query and data object are interpreted. 

| Property | Description |
| `concept` | the concept that is found in this step. |
| `distanceToNext` | the distance to the next step (null for the last step). |
| `distanceToPrevious` | this distance to the previous step (null for the first step). |
| `distanceToQuery` | the distance of this step to the query. |
| `distanceToResult` | the distance of the step to this result. |

_Note: Building a semantic path is only possible if an [`nearText: {}` filter](#neartext) is set. As the explore term represents the beginning of the path and each search result represents the end of the path. Since `nearText: {}` queries are currently exclusively possible in GraphQL, the `semanticPath` is therefore not available in the REST API._

Example: showing a semantic path without edges.

{% include code/1.x/graphql.underscoreproperties.semanticpath.html %}

## Nearest Neighbors

The nearest neighbors additional property displays the nearest concepts to the object in the search results. You can use it in combination will all other search filters but you don't have to. 

{% include code/1.x/graphql.underscoreproperties.nearestneighbors.html %}


# Contextual Classification

The `text2vec-contextionary` also provides an additional classification method. If you don't have any training data and want to classify how similar a source item is to a potential target item, contextual classification is the right pick. Especially when there is a strong semantic relation in your data (e.g., `The Landmark Eiffel Tower` and `The City Paris`). See other types of classifications (kNN) provided by Weaviate Core [here](../restful-api-references/classification.html).

### Example use case

Imagine you have a dataset comprised of Magazine Articles (sources). You don’t know what each article is about, but you know that each article falls into one of three categories (targets): “politics,” “fashion,” or “technology.” There are no additional business rules involved, and you don’t have any training data. This is a good fit for a “contextual” classification. In such a classification, each Article will be analyzed, and the most important words will be extracted. These words are then compared - using their vector space distance - to one of the three targets. For example, in an article about “technology,” Weaviate has found the words “computer, “macintosh,” and “hardware” to be the most important words. These three words are closer in the vector space to “technology” than they are to “fashion” or “politics.” Weaviate will thus put them in the “technology” category. Each article is treated independently. How many articles have already been categorized into a specific category does not influence future articles.

## Endpoint and parameters

A classification can be started via the `v1/classifications` endpoint, which can also be accessed via the client libraries. The following fields must (required) or can (optional) be specified along with the `POST` request:

**Required**:
- `type: "text2vec-contextionary-contextual"`: the type of the classification, which is text2vec-contextionary-contextual here.
- `class`: the class name of the data objects to be classified.
- `classifyProperties`: a list of properties which values to classify. The individual properties of the class should be reference properties to other classes, which should only refer to one class. This is defined by the `dataType` in the schema, which thus should be an array consisting of exactly one class name.
- `basedOnProperties`: one or more of the other properties of the class, this field must be specified, but the current implementation takes the whole vector of the class (objects) into account.

**Optional, with default values**:
- Parameters to control weights of individual words: (Note: these parameters are highly specific to a dataset, the default values are set to work with many datasets.)
  - `informationGainCutoffPercentile: 50`. All words in a corpus are ranked by their information gain against the possible target objects. A cutoff percentile of 40 implies that the top 40% are used and the bottom 60% are cut-off. This highly depends on the data set. On the 20 news group data set (posts written by humans, between 10 and 3000 words), the best results are with a value of 8 whereas in a dataset with 1-2 word product description the best value would be 100 (i.e. no cut-off).
  - `informationGainMaximumBoost: 3`. Words in a corpus will receive an additional boost based on how high they are ranked according to information gain. Setting this value to `3` implies that the top-ranked word will be ranked 3 times as high as the bottom ranked word. The curve in between is logarithmic. A maximum boost of `1` implies that no boosting occurs.
  - `tfidfCutoffPercentile: 80`. All words in a corpus are ranked by their tf-idf score. A cutoff percentile of 80 implies that the top 80% are used and the bottom 20% are cut-off. This is very effective to remove words that occur in almost all objects, such as filler and stop words. Note that tf-idf compares the words in the corpus to those in other corpora (sources) whereas information gain compares the words in the corpus to possible target objects.
  - `minimumUsableWords: 3`. Both information gain (IG) and tf-idf are mechanisms to remove words from the corpora. However, on very short corpora this could lead to a removal of all words, or all but a single word. This value guarantees that - regardless of tf-idf and IG score - always at least n words are used.
- Parameters to add limitations (based on e.g. background business knowledge).
  - `filters: {}` with the following possible properties:
    - `sourceWhere: {}`. Parameter to determine which data objects to classify (i.e. you can use this if you want to leave out some data objects to classify them later based on background knowledge). It accepts a [`where` filter body](../graphql-references/filters.html#where-filter).
    - `targetWhere: {}`. Parameter to limit possible targets (i.e. when it you want to make sure no data objects will be classified as such). It accepts a [`where` filter body](../graphql-references/filters.html#where-filter).
    - `trainingSetWhere: {}`. Parameter to limit possible data objects in the training set. It accepts a [`where` filter body](../graphql-references/filters.html#where-filter).


### Start a contextual classification

A classification can be started through one of the clients, or with a direct `curl` request to the RESTful API.

{% include code/1.x/classification.contextual.post.html %}

A classification is started, and will run in the background. The following response is given after starting the classification, and the status can be fetched via the `v1/classifications/{id}` endpoint.

```json
{
  "basedOnProperties": [
    "summary"
  ],
  "class": "Article",
  "classifyProperties": [
    "ofCategory"
  ],
  "id": "973e3b4c-4c1d-4b51-87d8-4d0343beb7ad",
  "informationGainCutoffPercentile": 50,
  "informationGainMaximumBoost": 3,
  "meta": {
    "completed": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "started": "2020-09-09T14:57:08.468Z"
  },
  "minimumUsableWords": 3,
  "status": "running",
  "tfidfCutoffPercentile": 80,
  "type": "text2vec-contextionary-contextual"
}
```

Note that following fields where added to the [basic classification return body](../restful-api-references/classification.html#response) when the classification was done with `text2vec-contextionary-contextual`:
```json
{
  "informationGainCutoffPercentile": int, // the configured Information Gain Cutoff percentile
  "informationGainMaximumBoost": int, // the configured Information Gain Maximum Boost
  "minimumUsableWords": int, // the configured Minimum usable words
  "tfidfCutoffPercentile": int // the configured TF-IDF cutoff
}
```

### Evaluation of single data object results
After the classification is completed, the concerning reference properties data objects in the Weaviate instance are updated according to the classification. These data objects will be represented similarly to other data objects. The results of a classification can be requested for the individual data objects through the [`v1/objects/{id}/?include=classification` RESTful endpoint](../restful-api-references/objects.html) or with the [GraphQL `_additional {classification}` field](../graphql-references/additional-properties.html#classification).


# More information

## Regulate semantic indexing

In the schema you can define advanced settings how data is stored and used by Weaviate. 

In some cases you want to be able to regulate specific parts of the schema to optimise indexing.

For example, a data object with the following schema:

```yaml
Article:
  title: Cows lose their jobs as milk prices drop
  summary: As his 100 diary cows lumberred over for their Monday...
```

which will be vectorized as:

```md
article cows lose their
jobs as milk prices drop summary
as his diary cows lumberred
over for their monday
```

By default, the `class name` and all property `values` *will* be taken in the calculation, but the `property names` *will not* be indexed. There are four ways how you can regulate the indexing.

#### 1. Index the Class name

You can disable indexing of the class name by adding `vectorizeClassName` to the class definition.

For example: to disable the indexing of the word `"Article"` (which is the class name) of the data object, you can set is like this:

```js
{
  "class": "Article",
  "moduleConfig": {
    "text2vec-contextionary": {  
      "vectorizeClassName": false            # default is true
    }
  }
  // etcetera
}
```

which will be vectorized as:

```md
cows lose their
jobs as milk prices drop summary
as his diary cows lumberred
over for their monday
```

#### 2. Indexing the property name

You can disable indexing of the property name by adding `vectorizePropertyName` to a property definition.

For example: to enable the indexing of the word "title" (which is the property name of the data object):

```js
{
  "class": "Article",
  "properties": [{
    "name": "title",
    "moduleConfig": {
      "text2vec-contextionary": {
        "vectorizePropertyName": true,    // whether name of the property is used in the calculation for the vector position of data objects. default is false
      }
    },
    // etcetera 
  }, {
    "name": "summary",
    // etcetera
  }]
}
```

which will be vectorized as:

```md
article title cows lose their
jobs as milk prices drop summary
as his diary cows lumberred
over for their monday
```

#### 3. Property value

By default, a property name and value is taken into the vector calculation of the data object. This is configurable by `text2vec-contextionary: {"skip": <true/false> }`, see 3a below. Additionally, you can regulate whether the data property is indexed in the storage mechanism, see 3b. The latter influences whether you can search for this property name or value by a GraphQL `where` search. 

**3a. Skip property value in data vectorization**

If you don't want the value and the name of a property influence the vectorization of a data object, you can choose to `skip` the property entirely in the vectorization. For example, you can choose to skip the value of `summary` to influence the vectorization: 

```js
{
  "class": "Article",
  "properties": [{
    "name": "title",
    // etcetera 
  }, {
    "name": "summary",
    "moduleConfig": {
      "text2vec-contextionary": {
        "skip": true,    // if true, the whole property will NOT be included in vectorization. default is false, meaning that the object will be NOT be skipped
      }
    }
    // etcetera
  }]
}
```

which will be vectorized as:

```md
article cows lose their
jobs as milk prices drop
```

Skipping a property means skipping the property `name` and the `value`. Therefor, you can not set `"skip":true` and set `vectorizePropertyName:true` simultaneously. `text2vec-contextionary: {"skip": <true/false> }` does not influence the storage of the data value itself. This is in control of the index system.  

**3b. Disable indexing of the entire property (not `text2vec-contextionary` specific)**

You can disable indexing of a property value by adding `indexInverted` to a property definition. Disable the indexing of a property value means that there will be no 'inverted index' built for this property. It is not possible to do (GraphQL `where`) searches on this property. 

For example: to disable the indexing of the values of "summary":

```js
{
  "class": "Article",
  "properties": [{
    "name": "summary",
    "indexInverted": false                # default is true
    // etcetera
  }, {
    "name": "title",
    // etcetera
  }]
}
```

which will be vectorized as:

```md
article cows lose their
jobs as milk prices drop
```

## Stopwords

Note that stopwords are automatically removed from camelCased and CamelCased names.

#### What stopwords are and why they matter

Stopwords are words that don't add semantic meaning to your concepts and are
extremely common in texts across different contexts. For example, the sentence
"a car is parked on the street" contains the following stopwords: "a", "is",
"on", "the". If we look at the sentence "a banana is lying on
the table", you would find the exact same stop words. So in those two sentences
over 50% of the words overlap. Therefore they would be considered somewhat
similar (based on the overall vector position).

However, if we remove stopwords from both sentences, they become "car parked
street" and "banana lying table". Suddently there are 0% identical words in the
sentences, so it becomes easier to perform vector comparisons. Note at this
point we cannot say whether both sentences are related or not. For this we'd
need to know how close the vector position of the sentence "car parked street"
is to the vector position of "banana lying table". But we do know that the
result can now be calculated with a lot less noise.

#### Behavior around stop words

Stopwords are useful for humans, so we don't want to encourage you to leave
them out completely. Instead weaviate will remove them whenever your schema
information is translated to vector positions.

In most cases you won't even notice that this happens in the background,
however, there are a few edge cases that might cause a validation error:

* If your camelCased class or property name consists **only** of stopwords,
  validation will fail. Example: `TheInA` is not a valid class name, however,
  `TheCarInAField` is (and would internally be represented as `CarField`).

* If your keyword list contains stop words, they will be removed. However, if
  every single keyword is a stop word, validation will fail.

#### How does Weaviate decide whether a word is a stop word or not?

The list of stopwords is derived from the contextionary version used and is
published alongside the contextionary files.

## Compound splitting

Sometimes Weaviate's Contextionary does not understand words which are compounded out of words it would otherwise understand. This impact is far greater in languages that allow for arbitrary compounding (such as Dutch or German) than in languages where compounding is not very common (such as English).

### Effect
Imagine you import an object of class `Post` with content `This is a thunderstormcloud`. The arbitrarily compounded word `thunderstormcloud` is not present in the Contextionary. So your object's position will be made up of the only words it recognizes: `"post", "this"` (`"is"` and `"a"` are removed as stopwords).

If you check how this content was vectorized using the `_interpretation` feature, you will see something like the following:

```json
"_interpretation": {
  "source": [
    {
      "concept": "post",
      "occurrence": 62064610,
      "weight": 0.3623903691768646
    },
    {
      "concept": "this",
      "occurrence": 932425699,
      "weight": 0.10000000149011612
    }
  ]
}
```

To overcome this limitation the optional **Compound Splitting Feature** can be enabled in the Contextionary. It will understand the arbitrary compounded word and interpret your object as follows:

  ```json
"_interpretation": {
  "source": [
    {
      "concept": "post",
      "occurrence": 62064610,
      "weight": 0.3623903691768646
    },
    {
      "concept": "this",
      "occurrence": 932425699,
      "weight": 0.10000000149011612
    },
    {
      "concept": "thunderstormcloud (thunderstorm, cloud)",
      "occurrence": 5756775,
      "weight": 0.5926488041877747
    }
  ]
}
  ```

Note that the newly found word (made up of the parts `thunderstorm` and `cloud` has the highest weight in the vectorization. So this meaning that would have been lost without Compound Splitting can now be recognized.

### How to enable
You can enable compound splitting in the configuration file of the `text2vec-contextionary`. See how this is done [here](#compound-splitting).

### Trade-Off Import speed vs Word recognition
Compound Splitting runs an any word that is otherwise not recognized. Depending on your dataset this can lead to a significantly longer import time (up to 100% longer). Therefore, you should carefully evaluate whether the higher precision in recognition or the faster import times are more important to your use case. As the benefit is larger in some languages (e.g. Dutch, German) than in others (e.g. English) this feature is turned off by default.

## Noise filtering

So called "noise words" are concatenated words of random words with no easily recognizable meaning. These words are present in the Contextionary training space, but are extremely rare and therefore distributed seemingly randomly. As a consequence, an "ordinary" result of querying features relying on nearest neighbors (additional properties `nearestNeighbors` or `semanticPath`) might contain such noise words as immediate neighbors.

To combat this noise, a neighbor filtering feature was introduced in the contextionary, which ignores words of the configured bottom percentile - ranked by occurrence in the respective training set. By default this value is set to the bottom 5th percentile. This setting can be overridden. To set another value, e.g. to ignore the bottom 10th percentile, provide the environment variable `NEIGHBOR_OCCURRENCE_IGNORE_PERCENTILE=10` to the `text2vec-contextionary` container (configuration file).
