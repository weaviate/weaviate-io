To authenticate against Weaviate with OIDC, you must select a flow made available by the identity provider and create the flow-specific authentication configuration.

This configuration will then be used by the Weaviate client to authenticate. The configuration includes secrets that help the client obtain an `access token` and, if configured, a `refresh token`.

The `access token` is added to the HTTP header of each request and is utilized for authentication with Weaviate. Typically, this token has a limited lifespan, and the `refresh token` can be employed to obtain a new set of tokens when necessary.
