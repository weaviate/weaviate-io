This OIDC flow uses the username and password to obtain required tokens for authentication.

Note that not every provider automatically includes a `refresh token` and an appropriate *scope* might be required that depends on your identity provider. The client uses *offline_access* as the default scope. This works with some providers, but as it depends on the configuration of the identity providers, we ask you to refer to the identity provider's documentation.

Without a refresh token, there is no possibility to acquire a new `access token` and the client becomes unauthenticated after expiration.

:::note
The Weaviate client does not save the username or password used.

They are only used to obtain the first tokens, after which existing tokens will be used to obtain subsequent tokens if possible.
