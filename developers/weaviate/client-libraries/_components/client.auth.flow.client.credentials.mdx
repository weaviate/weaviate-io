This OIDC flow uses a `client secret` to obtain required tokens for authentication.

This flow is recommended for server-to-server communication without end-users and authenticates an application to Weaviate. This authentication flow is typically regarded as more secure than the resource owner password flow:  a compromised client secret can be simply revoked, whereas a compromised password may have larger implications beyond the scope of breached authentication.

To authenticate a client secret most identity providers require a *scope* to be specified. This *scope* depends on the configuration of the identity providers, so we ask you to refer to the identity provider's documentation.

Most providers do not include a refresh token in their response so `client secret` is saved in the client to obtain a new `access token` on expiration of the existing one.
