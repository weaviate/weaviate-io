The TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

The [TypeScript client v3](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) supports `Node.js` server based development. It does not support browser based web client development. To develop a browser based application, use the [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2).

## Clients


The [v3 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) is the current TypeScript client. If you have code written for the v2 client, you should migrate it to v3.

The [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2) version is still available in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-ts-client?activeTab=versions), however you should not use it to begin new projects.

If you have suggestions or comments on how to improve the new client, let us know:

- [Community forum](https://forum.weaviate.io)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)
- [Slack](https://weaviate.io/slack)

## Older clients

The v3 TypeScript client replaces the [v2 JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-client) only client. The JavaScript client is no longer supported. If you have older code that uses the JavaScript client, update to the TypeScript client.
