The TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

The upcoming [TypeScript client v3](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) supports `Node.js` server based development. It does not support browser based web client development. To develop a browser based application, use the [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2).

## Clients

The current [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2) version is `v||site.typescript_client_version||`.

The [v3 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) is available as a release candidate (RC).

If you have suggestions or comments on how to improve the new client, let us know:

- [Community forum](https://forum.weaviate.io) 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)
- [Slack](https://weaviate.io/slack)


## Older clients

The TypeScript client replaces the [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-client) only client. The JavaScript client is no longer supported. If you have older code that uses the JavaScript client, update to the TypeScript client.
