:::note TypeScript client version
The TypeScript client is version `v||site.typescript_client_version||`. Use the [TypeScript v3 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) for new projects.

If you are migrating a project from the Weaviate TypeScript client v2 to the v3 client, see the [migration page](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/v2_v3_migration) for additional details.

## Client configuration

This section details how install and configure the v3 TypeScript client.

### Install the package

The v3 client package has a new name, `weaviate-client`. Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the TypeScript client library package:

```bash
npm install weaviate-client
```

### Import the Client

The v3 client uses `ES Modules`. Most of the sample code in the documentation also uses the `ES Module` style.

If your code requires `CommonJS` compatibility, use the `CommonJS` import style:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="esm" label="ES Modules">

```ts
import weaviate from 'weaviate-client'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cjs" label="CommonJS">

```ts
const weaviate = require('weaviate-client').default;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### TypeScript setup

Edit your project's configuration files to make these changes:

- Add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`
- Add the following code to [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

<details>
    <summary>tsconfig.json file</summary>

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
  }
}
```

</details>

## Connect a client

The v3 client provides helper functions to connect your application to your Weaviate instance.

[Embedded Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded) is not supported in the v3 client. The v2 client supports embedded Weaviate.

### Connect to Weaviate

<Tabs groupId="platforms">
<TabItem value="wcd" label="WCD">

```ts
import weaviate from 'weaviate-client'

const client = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  'WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL', { // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey('WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY'),
    headers: {
      'X-OpenAI-Api-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || '',  // Replace with your inference API key
    }
  }
)

console.log(client)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

```ts
import weaviate from 'weaviate-client'

const client = await weaviate.connectToLocal()

console.log(client)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom" label="Custom">

```ts
import weaviate from 'weaviate-client'

const client = await weaviate.connectToCustom({
    httpHost: 'localhost',
    httpPort: 8080,
    grpcHost: 'localhost',
    grpcPort: 50051,
    grpcSecure: true,
    httpSecure: true,
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey('WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY'),
    headers: {
      'X-Cohere-Api-Key': process.env.COHERE_API_KEY || '' // Replace with your inference API key
    }
  })

console.log(client)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Close client method

import TSClientClose from '/_includes/clients/ts-client-close.mdx';

<TSClientClose />

### Authentication

import ClientAuthApiKey from '/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/_components/client.auth.api.key.mdx'

<ClientAuthApiKey />

```ts
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from 'weaviate-client';

// Instantiate the client with the auth config
const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  'WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL', // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  {
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey('WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY'), // Add your WCD API KEY here
  }
)

console.log(client)
```

To include custom headers, such as API keys for third party services, add the custom headers to the `headers` section when you initialize the client:

```ts
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from 'weaviate-client';

const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  'WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL', // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  {
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey('WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY'), // Add your WCD API KEY here
    headers: {
      someHeaderName: 'header-value',
    }
  }
)
```

The client sends the headers every it makes a request to the Weaviate instance.

## Changes in v3

This section highlights some features of the v3 TypeScript client.

### Design philosophy

The v3 client interacts with collections as the primary way to work with objects in your Weaviate database.

Your application code creates an object that represents a collection. This object enables search and CRUD operations to be performed against it.

This example returns objects from the `JeopardyQuestion` collection.

```js
const myCollection = client.collections.get('JeopardyQuestion');

const result = await myCollection.query.fetchObjects()

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```

### Node support only

The gRPC protocol is fast and provides other internal benefits. Unfortunately, gRPC does not support browser-based client development.

The v3 client uses gRPC to connect to your Weaviate instance. The client supports Node.js, server-based development. It does not support browser-based web client development.

To develop a browser-based application, use the [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2).

### Batch Inserts

The `insertMany()` method makes it easier to bulk insert a large number of objects.

For inserts of over 5000 objects, use `insertMany()` as part of a batch process:

import FilteredTextBlock from '@site/src/components/Documentation/FilteredTextBlock';
import TSCode from '!!raw-loader!/_includes/code/howto/manage-data.import.ts';

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={TSCode}
  startMarker="// START BatchGRPC"
  endMarker="// END BatchGRPC"
  language="ts"
/>

### Iterator Method

The cursor API has a new iterator method. To repeat an action over an entire collection, use `iterator()`.

```js
const articles = client.collections.get('Article')

for await (const article of articles.iterator()) {
  // do something with article.
  console.log(article) // we print each object in the collection
}
```

### Generics

TypeScript users can define custom Generics. Generics make it easier to manipulate objects and their properties. Compile time type checks help to ensure that operations like `insert()` and `create()` are safe and error free.

```js
import weaviate from 'weaviate-client';

type Article = {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  wordcount: number;
}

const collection = client.collections.get<Article>('Article');
await collection.data.insert({ // compiler error since 'body' field is missing in '.insert'
  title: 'TS is awesome!',
  wordcount: 9001
})
```

### Async operations

All client v3 methods, with the exception of `collection.use()`, use ES6 Promises with asynchronous code. This means you have to use `.then()` after function calls, or wrap your code `async/await` blocks.

When there is an asynchronous code error, a promise returns the specific error message. If you use `async` and `await`, a rejected promises acts like a thrown exception

### Type Safety

The v3 client enables strong typing with custom TypeScript types and user-defined generics.

You can find the type definitions in the folder that stores your Weaviate client package. The package is stored in a folder under the `node/` directory. Custom type definitions are stored in sub-folder for each bundle.

For example, the `index.d.ts` file stores type definitions for the `cjs` bundle:

```bash
node/cjs/index.d.ts
```

The v3 client also adds internal features that make JavaScript development more type-safe.

## Example code

Here are some resources to help you get started using the client.

### Recipes

The [recipes repository](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes-ts) on GitHub has sample code for common use cases.

### Demo applications

There are demo applications written in TypeScript and JavaScript here:

- [QuoteFinder](https://github.com/weaviate/quote-finder/tree/main)
- [NuxtVectorSearch](https://github.com/malgamves/nuxt-typescript-vector-search)
