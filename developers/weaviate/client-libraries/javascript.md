## Installation and setup

The JavaScript client library package can be easily installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

<!-- Replace $ .. examples to remove the prompt ($) as it gets copied too along with the actual command -->
```bash
$ npm install weaviate-client
```

Now you can use the client in your JavaScript scripts as follows:

```javascript
const weaviate = require("weaviate-client");

const client = weaviate.client({
  scheme: 'http',
  host: 'localhost:8080',
});

client
  .schema
  .getter()
  .do()
  .then(res => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err)
  });
```

## Authentication

import ClientAuthIntro from '/_includes/client.auth.introduction.mdx'

<ClientAuthIntro clientName="JavaScript"/>

### Resource Owner Password flow

import ClientAuthFlowResourceOwnerPassword from '/_includes/client.auth.flow.resource.owner.password.mdx'

<ClientAuthFlowResourceOwnerPassword />


```js
const client = weaviate.client({
  scheme: "http",
  host: "weaviate-host",
  authClientSecret: new weaviate.AuthUserPasswordCredentials({
    username: "user123",
    password: "password"
    scopes: ["scope1", "scope2"]  // optional, depends on the configuration of your identity provider
  })
});
```

### Client Credentials flow

import ClientAuthFlowClientCredentials from '/_includes/client.auth.flow.client.credentials.mdx'

<ClientAuthFlowClientCredentials />

```js
const client = weaviate.client({
  scheme: "http",
  host: "weaviate-host",
  authClientSecret: new weaviate.AuthClientCredentials({
    clientSecret: "supersecuresecret",
    scopes: ["scope1", "scope2"]  // optional, depends on the configuration of your identity provider
  })
});
```

### Refresh Token flow

import ClientAuthBearerToken from '/_includes/client.auth.bearer.token.mdx'

<ClientAuthBearerToken />

```js
const client = weaviate.client({
  scheme: "http",
  host: "weaviate-host",
  authClientSecret: new weaviate.AuthAccessTokenCredentials({
    accessToken: "abcd1234",
    expiresIn: 900,
    refreshToken: "efgh5678"
  })
});
```

## Custom headers

You can pass custom headers to the client, which are added at initialization:

```js
const client = weaviate.client({
    scheme: 'http',
    host: 'weaviate-host',
    headers: {headerName: 'HeaderValue'}
  });
```

These headers will then be included in every request that the client makes.

## References

All [RESTful endpoints](../api/rest/index.md) and [GraphQL functions](../api/graphql/index.md) references covered by the JS client, and explained on those reference pages in the code blocks.

## Design

### Builder pattern

The JavaScript client is designed with a 'Builder pattern'. A pattern is used to build complex query objects. This means that a function (for example to retrieve data from Weaviate with a request similar to a RESTful GET request, or a more complex GraphQL query) is built with single objects to reduce complexity. Some builder objects are optional, others are required to perform specific functions. All is documented on the [RESTful API reference pages](../api/rest/index.md) and the [GraphQL reference pages](../api/graphql/index.md).

The code snippet above shows a simple query similar to `RESTful GET /v1/schema`. The client is initiated with requiring the package and connecting to the running instance. Then, a query is constructed with getting the `.schema` with `.getter()`. The query will be sent with the `.do()` function, this object is thus required for every function you want to build and execute. 

### General notes
- All methods use ES6 Promises to deal with asynchronous code. So you need to use `.then()` at the end of the function, or have async/await support.  
- In the case of an error, the Promise rejects with the specific error message. (If using async/await a rejected promises acts like a thrown exception).
- Internally the client uses isomorphic-fetch to do the REST calls, so the client should work from both the browser as well as NodeJS backend applications without any required changes.
