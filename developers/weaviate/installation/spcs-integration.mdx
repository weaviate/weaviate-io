Snowflake provides a hosted solution, [Snowpark Container Services (SPCS)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview), that runs containers inside the Snowflake ecosystem. To configure a Weaviate instance that runs in SPCS, follow the steps on this page.

The code in this guide configures a sample SPCS instance. The sample instance demonstrates how to run Weaviate in Snowpark. To configure your own SPCS instance, change the database name, warehouse name, image repository name, and other example values to match your deployment.

## Configure your instance
### 1. Log into Snowflake

Download the [SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql) client. Use the SnowSQL client to connect to Snowflake.

```bash  
snowsql -a "YOURINSTANCE" -u "YOURUSER"
```

### 2. Setup the user environment

Configure roles and services.

#### Configure OAUTH

Set up OAUTH integration. Snowflake uses OAUTH to authenticate users to your service.

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION SNOWSERVICES_INGRESS_OAUTH
  TYPE=oauth
  OAUTH_CLIENT=snowservices_ingress
  ENABLED=true;
```

#### Grant SYSADMIN privileges

The SYSADMIN uses the BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT to create services.

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
```

#### Create Weaviate role and user

Create a role, and a user, for the Weaviate instance. The Jupyter server uses the Weaviate user.

```sql
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
CREATE ROLE WEAVIATE_ROLE;

USE ROLE USERADMIN;
CREATE USER weaviate_user
  PASSWORD='weaviate123'
  DEFAULT_ROLE = WEAVIATE_ROLE
  DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES = ('ALL')
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE;
  
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
GRANT ROLE WEAVIATE_ROLE TO USER weaviate_user;
```

### 3. Configure data storage

Create a database, an image repository, and stages. The image repository holds container images. The stages hold service specification files and files that the service creates.

#### Create a warehouse

Create a warehouse to use with Weaviate.

```sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE WEAVIATE_WAREHOUSE WITH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE='X-SMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 180
  AUTO_RESUME = true
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED=false;
```

#### Create a database

Create a Weaviate database and stages.

```sql  
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS WEAVIATE_DEMO;
USE DATABASE WEAVIATE_DEMO;
CREATE IMAGE REPOSITORY WEAVIATE_DEMO.PUBLIC.WEAVIATE_REPO;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE YAML_STAGE;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE DATA ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE FILES ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
```

#### Grant privileges

Grant privileges to the WEAVIATE_ROLE:

```sql
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE WEAVIATE_DEMO TO WEAVIATE_ROLE;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA WEAVIATE_DEMO.PUBLIC TO WEAVIATE_ROLE;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON WAREHOUSE WEAVIATE_WAREHOUSE TO WEAVIATE_ROLE;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON STAGE WEAVIATE_DEMO.PUBLIC.FILES TO WEAVIATE_ROLE;
```

#### Allow external access

:::warning External access
The user credentials on this page are for demonstration purposes only. Change the user credentials and password before you connect to the open internet.
:::
  
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
USE DATABASE WEAVIATE_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;
CREATE NETWORK RULE allow_all_rule
  TYPE = 'HOST_PORT'
  MODE= 'EGRESS'
  VALUE_LIST = ('0.0.0.0:443','0.0.0.0:80');

CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION allow_all_eai
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES=(allow_all_rule)
  ENABLED=TRUE;

GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION allow_all_eai TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
```

### 4. Setup compute pools

Create compute pools. The compute pools run the application services. 

```sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS WEAVIATE_COMPUTE_POOL
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 1
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_S
  AUTO_RESUME = true;
CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS TEXT2VEC_COMPUTE_POOL
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 1
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = GPU_NV_S
  AUTO_RESUME = true;
CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS JUPYTER_COMPUTE_POOL
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 1
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_S
  AUTO_RESUME = true;
```

To configure your own instance, edit the pool names and pool sizes to support your application.

To check if the compute pools are active, run `DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL <Pool Name>`.

```sql
DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL WEAVIATE_COMPUTE_POOL;
DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL TEXT2VEC_COMPUTE_POOL;
DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL JUPYTER_COMPUTE_POOL;
```

The compute pools take a few minutes to initialize. The pools are ready for use when they reach the `ACTIVE` or `IDLE` state.

### 5. Build the Docker images

Build the Docker images in your local shell. There are three images.

- The Weaviate image runs the database.
- The `text2vec` image lets you process data without leaving Snowpark.
- The Jupyter image serves notebooks.

The Docker files are in [this repo](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-weaviate-on-spcs/tree/main/images). Clone the repo, and go to the top level directory. 

You don't need to modify the Dockerfiles to run this sample instance. However, if you need to use non-standard ports, or make other changes for your deployment, edit the Dockerfiles before you create the containers.

```bash
docker build --rm --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t weaviate ./images/weaviate
docker build --rm --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t jupyter ./images/jupyter
docker build --rm --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t text2vec ./images/text2vec
```

Log in to your Docker repository. The Snowpark account name, username, and password are the same as your `snowsql` credentials.

```bash
docker login <YOUR_SNOWACCOUNT>-<SNOWORG>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com  -u YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME
```

After you login to the Docker repository, tag the images and push them to the repository.

The `docker tag` commands look like this:

```bash
docker tag weaviate <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/weaviate
docker tag jupyter <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/jupyter
docker tag text2vec <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/text2vec
```

The `docker push` commands look like this:

```bash
docker push <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/weaviate
docker push <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/jupyter
docker push <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/text2vec
```

### 6. Setup services

SPCS uses `spec files` to configure services. The configuration spec files are also in [the repo](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-weaviate-on-spcs/tree/main/specs) you cloned earlier. 

Edit the `spec files` to specify an image repository for each service. For example, update `weaviate.yaml` to reference the `weaviate`
image. 

```bash
image: "<SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/weaviate_demo/public/weaviate_repo/weaviate"
```

When you edit the `jupyter.yaml` spec file, update the `SNOW_ACCOUNT` field with your Snowflake account name. 

```bash
SNOW_ACCOUNT: <SNOWFLAKE_ORG>-<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT>
```

After the spec files are updated, use the `snowsql` client to upload them. 

```sql
PUT file:///path/to/jupyter.yaml @yaml_stage overwrite=true auto_compress=false;
PUT file:///path/to/text2vec.yaml @yaml_stage overwrite=true auto_compress=false;
PUT file:///path/to/weaviate.yaml @yaml_stage overwrite=true auto_compress=false;
```

### 7. Create the services

Use the `snowsql` client to create a service for each component.

```sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
USE DATABASE WEAVIATE_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

CREATE SERVICE WEAVIATE
  IN COMPUTE POOL WEAVIATE_COMPUTE_POOL 
  FROM @YAML_STAGE
  SPEC='weaviate.yaml'
  MIN_INSTANCES=1
  MAX_INSTANCES=1;

CREATE SERVICE JUPYTER
  IN COMPUTE POOL JUPYTER_COMPUTE_POOL 
  FROM @YAML_STAGE
  SPEC='jupyter.yaml'
  MIN_INSTANCES=1
  MAX_INSTANCES=1;

CREATE SERVICE TEXT2VEC
  IN COMPUTE POOL TEXT2VEC_COMPUTE_POOL 
  FROM @YAML_STAGE
  SPEC='text2vec.yaml'
  MIN_INSTANCES=1
  MAX_INSTANCES=1;

```  

### 8. Grant user permissions

Grant permission for the services to the `weaviate_role`. 

```sql
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
GRANT USAGE ON SERVICE WEAVIATE_DEMO.PUBLIC.JUPYTER TO ROLE WEAVIATE_ROLE;
```

### 9. Log in to the Jupyter Notebook server

Get the `ingress_url` URL that you use to access the Jupyter notebook server.

```sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE WEAVIATE_DEMO.PUBLIC.JUPYTER;
```

Open the `ingress_url` in a browser. Use the `weaviate_user` credentials to log in. 

### 10. Load data into your Weaviate instance

Follow these steps to create a schema, and load some sample data into your Weaviate instance.

1. Download [a set of sample Jeopardy Questions](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/blob/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json).
1. Rename the file `SampleJSON.json`, and save it to your desktop.
1. Upload the file. Drag the file into the Jupyter tree view in your browser or use the 'Upload' button at the upper-right corner.
1. Copy the data into Weaviate. Use the `TestWeaviate.ipynb` notebook to copy the data from `SampleJSON.json` into Weaviate.

## Query your data

To query your data, run these queries in the a Jupyter notebook.

```python
import weaviate
import json
import os

client = weaviate.connect_to_custom(
    http_host="weaviate",
    http_port="8080",
    http_secure=False,
    grpc_host="weaviate",
    grpc_port="50051",
    grpc_secure=False
)

collection = client.collections.get("Questions")

# Simple search
response = collection.query.near_text(query="animal",limit=2, include_vector=True)
#confirm vectors exist
for o in response.objects:
    print(o.vector)

# Hybrid search	client.close()
response = collection.query.hybrid(	
    query="animals",	
    limit=5	
)	

client.close()
```

## Suspend and resume services

To suspend and resume services, run the following code in to the `snowsql` client.

### Suspend services
```sql
alter service WEAVIATE suspend;
alter service TEXT2VEC suspend;
alter service JUPYTER suspend;
```

### Resume services:
```sql
alter service WEAVIATE resume;
alter service TEXT2VEC resume;
alter service JUPYTER resume;
```

## Cleanup and Removal

To remove the services, run the following code in to the `snowsql` client.

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
DROP USER weaviate_user;

USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
DROP SERVICE WEAVIATE;
DROP SERVICE JUPYTER;
DROP SERVICE TEXT2VEC;
DROP COMPUTE POOL TEXT2VEC_COMPUTE_POOL;
DROP COMPUTE POOL WEAVIATE_COMPUTE_POOL;
DROP COMPUTE POOL JUPYTER_COMPUTE_POOL;
DROP STAGE DATA;
DROP STAGE FILES;
DROP IMAGE REPOSITORY WEAVIATE_DEMO.PUBLIC.WEAVIATE_REPO;
DROP DATABASE WEAVIATE_DEMO;
DROP WAREHOUSE WEAVIATE_WAREHOUSE;

USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
DROP ROLE WEAVIATE_ROLE;
DROP SECURITY INTEGRATION SNOWSERVICES_INGRESS_OAUTH;
```
