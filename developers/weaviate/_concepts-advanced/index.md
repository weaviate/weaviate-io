## Overview

This section includes explanations of more advanced concepts, including Weaviate's architecture and in-depth discussions of vector indexing. If you are curious about how Weaviate works under the hood, or how it is designed to scale, you are at the right place.

This section does not need to be read linearly. We do recommend that you read the [essential concepts](../concepts/index.md) section first if you have not already.
