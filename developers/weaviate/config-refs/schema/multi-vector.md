## Syntax

Single vector collections are valid and continue to use the original collection syntax. If, however, you configure multiple vectors, you must use the new, named vector syntax. 

### Python client v4

Staring in v4.5.0, the [Python client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python) supports named vectors. 

#### Create a schema

Weaviate collections require a schema. Use the schema definition to configure the vector spaces in each data object.

- To configure named vectors, use `NamedVectors`.
- To specify which inputs go to which vectorizers, set `source_properties`.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# START SetSourceSchemaExample"
  endMarker="# END SetSourceSchemaExample"
  language="py"
/>

In this example, each data item has three fields, `question`, `answer`, and `category`. When Weaviate imports the data, the schema specifies how to handle each field. Data values can be stored as properties, vectors or both.

| Data field | Property | Vectorizer |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `category` | yes | none |
| `question` | yes | `text2vec_cohere` | 
| `answer` | yes | `text2vec_openai` |

#### Query a named vector

[Keyword searches](/developers/weaviate/search/bm25) in collections with named vectors use the same syntax as keyword searches in collections without named vectors. However, if you run a vector search on a collection with named vectors, specify the vector space to search.

Use named vectors with [vector similarity searches](/developers/weaviate/search/similarity) (`near_text`, `near_object`, `near_vector`, `near_image`) and [hybrid search](/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid).

To run the example query, first create the sample collection.

<details>
  <summary>Create sample collection.</summary>

This code creates a sample collection and imports a small amount of data.<br/><br/>To run the code, you must have an OpenAI API key and a Cohere API key defined as local variables on your system.<br/><br/>OpenAi and Cohere are third party services. You may incur a cost if you exceed the limits of their free tiers.

  startMarker="# START LoadDataNamedVectors"
  endMarker="# END LoadDataNamedVectors"
  language="py"
/>

</details>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# START NamedVectorQueryExample"
  endMarker="# END NamedVectorQueryExample"
  language="py"
/>



### REST API

The legacy, single vector syntax is valid for use with collections that don't have named vectors:

```json
{
    "class": "Article",
    "vector": [0.3, -0.012, 0.071, ..., -0.09], 
    "properties": {
        "content": Really cool things",
    }
}
```

To specify named vectors in collections with multiple, named vectors use the new syntax.

```json
{
    "class": "ArticleNamedVector",
    "vectors": {
        "title_vector": [0.3, 0.2, 0.6, ..., 0.1]},
        "image_vector": [1,2,3,4]
    },
    "properties": {
        "content": "Really cool things",
    }
}
```

To retrieve all vectors at once, use this endpoint: 

```bash
GET /v1/objects/<ClassName>/<uuid>?include=vector
```

### GraphQL

When there is only one vector, a `nearObject` query looks like this:

```json
{
    Get {
      Publication(
        nearVector: {
          vector: [0.1, -0.15, 0.3]
        }
      ){
				content
        _additional {
          vector # backward compatible if only one vector present
          vectors {
            title
          }
          distance
        }
      }
    }
}
```

If a collection has multiple vectors, use the `_additional {vectors {name}}` field to specify the search vector in the query.

These examples show GraphQL queries:

## Hybrid search

Named vector collections support [hybrid search](/weaviate/search/hybrid), but only for one vector at a time. To run a hybrid search, specify the vector to use:

```json
{
  Get {
    Article (
      hybrid: {
        properties: ["content"]
        targetVectors: ["title"] # Only one vector is supported
				query: "foo"
      })
     {
      content
      _additional {
				score
			}
    }
  }
}
```
