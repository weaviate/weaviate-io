### `objects` vs `batch`

:::tip
The `objects` endpoint is meant for individual object creations.
:::

If you plan on importing a large number of objects, it's much more efficient to use the `/v1/batch` endpoint. Otherwise, sending multiple single requests sequentially would incur a large performance penalty:

1. Each sequential request would be handled by a single thread server-side while most of the server resources are idle. In addition, if you only send the second request once the first has been completed, you will wait for a lot of network overhead.
1. It's much more efficient to parallelize imports. This will minimize the connection overhead and use multiple threads server-side for indexing.
1. You do not have to do the parallelization yourself, you can use the `/v1/batch` endpoint for this. Even if you are sending batches from a single client thread, the objects within a batch will be handled by multiple server threads.
1. Import speeds, especially for large datasets, will drastically improve when using the batching endpoint.

:::note Idempotence of POST requests in `objects` and `batch`
The idempotence behavior differs between these two endpoints. POST /batch/objects is idempotent, and will overwrite any existing object given an id. POST /objects will fail if an id is provided which already exists in the class.

To update an existing object with the `objects` endpoint, use the `PUT` or `PATCH` method.
:::

For best performance, we recommend using batching for insertion and deletion. Also consider that:

1. The vectorization module/tool may be acting as a bottleneck.
1. Avoid duplicate vectors for multiple data objects.
1. Object-level errors may occur even if the batch request is successful.
1. If your import slows down after a particular number of objects (e.g. 2M), check to see if the [`vectorCacheMaxObjects`](./schema/vector-index.md#how-to-configure-hnsw) in your schema is larger than the number of objects. Also, see [this example](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate/blob/d4711f2bdc75afd503ff70092c3c5303f9dd1b3b/step-2/import.py#L58-L59).

### With a custom vector

When creating a data object, you can configure Weaviate to generate a vector with a vectorizer module, or you can provide the vector yourself. We sometimes refer to this as a "custom" vector.

You can provide a custom vector during object creation either when:
- you are not using a vectorizer for that class, or
- you are using a vectorizer, but you wish to bypass it during the object creation stage.

You can create a data object with a custom vector as follows:
1. Set the `"vectorizer"` in the relevant class in the [data schema](../../manage-data/collections.mdx#specify-a-vectorizer).
    - If you are not using a vectorizer at all, configure the class accordingly. To do this, you can:
        - set the default vectorizer module to `"none"` (`DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE="none"`), or
        - set the `"vectorizer"` for the class to `"none"` (`"vectorizer": "none"`) (*note: the class `vectorizer` setting will override the `DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE` parameter*).
    - If you wish to bypass the vectorizer for object creation:
      - set the vectorizer to the same vectorizer with identical settings used to generate the custom vector
    > *Note: There is NO validation of this vector besides checking the vector length.*
2. Then, attach the vector in a special `"vector"` field during object creation. For example, if adding a single object, you can:

<SemanticKindCreateVector/>

:::note
You can set custom vectors for batch imports as well as single object creation.

## `classification` - additional object fields

| Field name | Data type | Required `include` or `additional` field | Description |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `closestLosingDistance` | float | `classification` | The lowest distance of a neighbor in the losing group. Optional. If `k` equals the size of the winning group, there is no losing group. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `closestOverallDistance` | float | `classification` | The lowest distance of any neighbor, regardless of whether they were in the winning or losing. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `closestWinningDistance` | float | `classification` | Closest distance of a neighbor from the winning group. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `losingCount` | integer | `classification` | Size of the losing group, can be 0 if the winning group size equals `k`. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `meanLosingDistance` | float | `classification` | The mean distance of the losing group. It is a normalized distance (between 0 and 1), where 0 means equal and 1 would mean a perfect opposite. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `meanWinningDistance` | float | `classification` | The mean distance of the winning group. It is a normalized distance (between 0 and 1), where 0 means equal and 1 would mean a perfect opposite. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `overallCount` | integer | `classification` | Overall neighbors checked as part of the classification. In most cases this will equal `k`, but could be lower than `k` - for example if not enough data was present. |
| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `winningCount` | integer | `classification` | Size of the winning group, a number between 1 and `k`. |
| `classification` > `basedOn` | string |  `classification` | The property name where the classification was based on. |
| `classification` > `classifiedFields` | string |  `classification` | The classified property. |
| `classification` > `completed` | timestamp |  `classification` | The time of classification completion. |
| `classification` > `id` | uuid |  `classification` | The classification id. |
| `classification` > `scope` | list of strings |  `classification` | The initial fields to classify. |

## `featureProjection` - additional object fields

| Field name | Data type | Required `include` or `additional` field | Description |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `featureProjection` > `vector` | list of floats |  `featureProjection` | The 2D or 3D vector coordinates of the feature projection. |
