## Overview

These **search** how-to guides aim to help you find the data you want using Weaviate.

import BasicPrereqs from '/_includes/prerequisites-quickstart.md';

<BasicPrereqs />

If you are new to Weaviate searches, we recommend starting with the [query basics](./basics.mdx) page, which covers the basic syntax of a search query, and how to specify the properties you want to retrieve. Then, move onto a how-to guide of your choice.

Then we have separate how-to guides for:

- [Semantic](TODO): Covers semantic or vector searches; functions able to compare objects in their "*vector space*".
- [BM25](TODO): A word "weight" based search algorithm.
- [Hybrid](TODO): Combines scalar and vector search.

Each of them are self-contained. So you can read them in any order.
