As a vector database, Weaviate can do the vectorization for you using an inference provider (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face), but it also lets you bring your own vectors - for the data and for queries. If you already have your vectors, performing a vector search with Weaviate looks like this:

1. Create a Weaviate instance
2. Authenticate to it
3. Import your data along with your own vectors
4. Perform a vector search with Weaviate


## Data

We'll use as an example a tiny dataset consisting of 10 questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!". Each object has an associated vector embedding, which was calculated using OpenAI with the <nobr>[`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)</nobr>. If your vectors have been generated by another inference provider, that's OK too - Weaviate has built-in modules for Cohere and Hugging Face.

## Installation

Weaviate is open source and you can easily [run the binary on Linux](../installation/embedded.md) or [run a local instance from a Docker image](../installation/docker-compose.md) on any OS, or even easier - you can create a free sandbox instance with the [Weaviate Cloud Services](../../wcs/quickstart.mdx) (WCS). Make sure to leave Authentication enabled, and while the instance is being created, read on!


## Client library

For the best experience with Weaviate, we recommend installing a Weaviate client library for one of these languages:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart.clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

For JavaScript/TypeScript, we'll also need the `node-fetch` library to download the dataset, so make sure to `npm install node-fetch`.


## Authentication

The recommended way to [authenticate](../configuration/authentication.md) to WCS is with an API key. Once the instance is ready, click on its <kbd>Details</kbd> button, then the key <kbd>ðŸ”‘</kbd> icon to access the API key:

import WCSGetKey from '../../wcs/guides/img/wcs-get-key.png';

<img src={WCSGetKey} width="100%" alt="Instance configuration"/>

Grab the "Admin" key. You'll need it later for the client instantiation, which looks like this:

import WCSAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.api.key.mdx';

<WCSAuthenticationApiKey/>


## Schema

Weaviate [stores data](../concepts/data.md) objects in class-based collections. Each object has a set of properties, and a vector representation generated automatically by a vectorizer, or specified at import time.

Weaviate lets you define vectorizers at the class level, with further control at the property level. Since you're bringing your own vectors, a vectorizer is not needed, so you could set `vectorizer: "none"` in the class.

:::note Best practice - set a compatible vectorizer
For more flexibility in your application, you can set the vectorizer to `text2vec-openai`, since the vectors were produced using the OpenAI API, and you may want to let Weaviate automatically call OpenAI to update them when the underlying data objects change. This will also let Weaviate automatically vectorize concepts passed to the [`nearText` operator](../api/graphql/vector-search-parameters.md#neartext).

If a class has a vectorizer specified but you provide a vector at import time, Weaviate will use your vector.

import CreateSchema from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.schema.mdx'

<CreateSchema />


## Import data with vectors

Here is the set of [10 pre-vectorized Jeopardy questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny+vectors.json) in JSON format. We'll import them into Weaviate using a batcher, which adds some complexity but offers maximum performance for large data sets as well:

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

<ImportQuestionsWithVectors />


## Query

Let's say you want to find questions related to biology. First you'll have to obtain your vector for "biology". In this example, we've used the OpenAI API to generate it, with the same [`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings). Then, pass that vector to the [`nearVector` parameter](../api/graphql/vector-search-parameters.md#nearvector):

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />


## Putting it together

The following code puts it all together, taking care of everything from schema definition to data import to query. Remember to replace the endpoint and Weaviate key.

import ByovAll from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.all.mdx'

<ByovAll />


## What next

import WhatNext from '/_includes/quickstart.what-next.mdx';
