## Overview

Welcome to the Weaviate **Quickstart tutorial**. 

This tutorial introduces you to Weaviate, and some of its main features. You will get hands-on experience running Weaviate and doing things with it.

### Data

We will begin with this (tiny) dataset consisting of questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!":

### What you will build

In this tutorial, you will build a Weaviate database with this data and then perform queries to retrieve relevant information from it. By the end, you will begin to see some of the benefits of vector search, and get some ideas on what you can do with Weaviate.

We also include brief optional chapters about [modules](./modules.md), and the [console](./console.md).

## Before you start 

### Assumed knowledge

The guide assumes that you are somewhat familiar with databases and vector embeddings. 

But don't worry too much even if you are uncomfortable with any of these. The guide is structured so you should be able to follow along even if some of the concepts are unfamiliar. And you can always revisit some of these ideas in the documentation. 

### Accounts and API keys

We recommend following along with the tutorial by creating free accounts with:
1. A [Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.io/) account, and
1. An account with an inference API provider such as:
    1. [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings),
    1. [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/embed), or
    1. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).

## Next

- Get started by [installing Weaviate](./installation.md).
