We cover these types of searches:

- [Query basics](./how-to-query-data.md): The basics of performing queries with Weaviate.
- [Vector/Semantic](./how-to-perform-a-semantic-search.md): Based on the concept of "similarity" of information; comparing objects in their AI-encoded "*vector space*".
- [Hybrid](./hybrid-search.md): Combines scalar and vector search principles.
- [BM25](./bm25.md): A word "weight" based search algorithm, suitable for long documents.

Each of these tutorials are self-contained. So you can read them in any order.
