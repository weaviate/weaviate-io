Anthropic offers a wide range of models for natural language processing and generation. Weaviate seamlessly integrates with Anthropic's APIs, allowing users to leverage Anthropic's models directly within the Weaviate database.

These integrations empower developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications with ease.

## Integrations with Anthropic

### Generative AI models for RAG

![Single prompt RAG integration generates individual outputs per search result](../_includes/integration_anthropic_rag_single.png)

Anthropic's generative AI models can generate human-like text based on given prompts and contexts.

[Weaviate's generative AI integration](./generative.md) enables users to perform retrieval augmented generation (RAG) directly within the Weaviate database. This combines Weaviate's efficient storage and fast retrieval capabilities with Anthropic's generative AI models to generate personalized and context-aware responses.
