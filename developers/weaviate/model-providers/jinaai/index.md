Jina AI offers a wide range of models for natural language processing. Weaviate seamlessly integrates with Jina AI's APIs, allowing users to leverage Jina AI's models directly within the Weaviate database.

These integrations empower developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications with ease.

## Integrations with Jina AI

### Embedding models for semantic search

![Embedding integration illustration](../_includes/integration_jinaai_embedding.png)

Jina AI's embedding models transform text data into high-dimensional vector representations, capturing semantic meaning and context.

[Weaviate integrates with Jina AI's embedding models](./embeddings.md) to enable seamless vectorization of data. This integration allows users to perform semantic and hybrid search operations without the need for additional preprocessing or data transformation steps.
