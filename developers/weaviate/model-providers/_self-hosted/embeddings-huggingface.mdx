# Hugging Face Hub embeddings with Weaviate (self-hosted)

Weaviate integrates with models from the Hugging Face Hub to provide convenient access to their vectorization capabilities from within Weaviate.

## System configuration

This is done through a separate containerized service that will run the embedding model and provide the embeddings to Weaviate.

Accordingly, you require:

- A Weaviate instance that is configured with the `text2vec-transformers` module

## Collection configuration
