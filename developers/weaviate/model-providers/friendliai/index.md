FriendliAI offers a wide range of models for natural language processing and generation. Weaviate seamlessly integrates with FriendliAI APIs, allowing users to leverage FriendliAI's inference engine within the Weaviate database.

FriendliAI integration empowers developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications with ease.

## Integrations with FriendliAI

### Generative AI models for RAG

![Single prompt RAG integration generates individual outputs per search result](../_includes/integration_friendliai_rag_single.png)

FriendliAI's generative AI models can generate human-like text based on given prompts and contexts.

[Weaviate's generative AI integration](./generative.md) enables users to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) directly within the Weaviate database. This combines Weaviate's efficient storage and fast retrieval capabilities with FriendliAI's generative AI models to generate personalized and context-aware responses.

Visit [FriendliAI generative AI integration page](./generative.md) for more information on our integrations with FriendliAI.

## Summary

This integration enables developers to harness the power of FriendliAI's inference engine within Weaviate.

In turn, it simplifies the process of building AI-driven applications to speed up your development process, so that you can focus on creating innovative solutions.
