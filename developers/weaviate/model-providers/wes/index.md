Weaviate Embedding Service (WES) offers vectorizer models to Weaviate Cloud users, allowing users to leverage WES' models directly from within the Weaviate Cloud database.

These integrations empower developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications with ease.

## Integrations with Weaviate Embedding Service

### Embedding models for semantic search

![Embedding integration illustration](../_includes/integration_wes_embedding.png)

Weaviate Embedding Service's embedding models transform text data into high-dimensional vector representations, capturing semantic meaning and context.

[Weaviate Cloud integrates with Weaviate Embedding Service's embedding models](./embeddings.md) to enable seamless vectorization of data. This integration allows users to perform semantic and hybrid search operations without the need for additional preprocessing or data transformation steps.

## Summary

These integrations enable developers to leverage Weaviate Embedding Service's powerful models directly within Weaviate.

In turn, they simplify the process of building AI-driven applications to speed up your development process, so that you can focus on creating innovative solutions.

## Get started

You must provide a valid Weaviate Cloud API key to Weaviate for these integrations. Go to [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) to sign up and obtain an API key.

Then, go to the relevant integration page to learn how to configure Weaviate with the WES models and start using them in your applications.
