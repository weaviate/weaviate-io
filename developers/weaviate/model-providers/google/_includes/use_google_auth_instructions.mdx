You can save your Google Vertex AI credentials and have Weaviate generate the necessary tokens for you. This enables use of IAM service accounts in private deployments that can hold Google credentials.

To do so:

- Set `USE_GOOGLE_AUTH` [environment variable](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars#module-specific) to `true`.
- Have the credentials available in one of the following locations.

Once appropriate credentials are found, Weaviate uses them to generate an access token and authenticates itself against Vertex AI. Upon token expiry, Weaviate generates a replacement access token.

In a containerized environment, you can mount the credentials file to the container. For example, you can mount the credentials file to the `/etc/weaviate/` directory and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to `/etc/weaviate/google_credentials.json`.

Once `USE_GOOGLE_AUTH` is set to `true`, Weaviate will look for credentials in the following places, preferring the first location found:

1. A JSON file whose path is specified by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. For workload identity federation, refer to [this link](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/how-to#using-workload-identity-federation) on how to generate the JSON configuration file for on-prem/non-Google cloud platforms.
2. A JSON file in a location known to the `gcloud` command-line tool. On Windows, this is `%APPDATA%/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`. On other systems, `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`.
3. On Google App Engine standard first generation runtimes (<= Go 1.9) it uses the appengine.AccessToken function.
4. On Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine standard second generation runtimes (>= Go 1.11), and Google App Engine flexible environment, it fetches credentials from the metadata server.
