[Weaviate Embeddings](/developers/wcs/embeddings) offers vectorizer models to Weaviate Cloud users, allowing users to leverage Weaviate Embeddings' models directly from a Weaviate Cloud database instance.

These integrations empower developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications with ease.

## Integrations with Weaviate Embeddings

### Embedding models for vector search

![Embedding integration illustration](../_includes/integration_wes_embedding.png)

Weaviate Embeddings' models transform text data into vector embeddings, capturing meaning and context.

[Weaviate Cloud integrates with Weaviate Embeddings' embedding models](./embeddings.md) to enable seamless vectorization of data. This integration allows users to perform semantic and hybrid search operations without the need for additional preprocessing or data transformation steps.
