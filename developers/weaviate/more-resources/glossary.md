| Term | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Beacon** | A beacon is a reference to a particular data object in Weaviate or inside the knowledge network. This data object in turn has a position in the vector space. Often defined as follows: `weaviate://{peerName}/{className}/{UUID}`. (For Weaviate version < `v1.14.0`, it is defined as follows: `weaviate://{peerName}/{UUID}`.) |
| **Class** | A class is a definition of a semantic kind. E.g., the class `Company` or the class `Movie`. In Weaviate, classes can be recognized because they always start with an uppercase letter. |
| **Concept** | Concepts are related to entities. Often you will use concepts to search in your datasets. If your dataset has data about _An Actor with the name Arnold Schwarzenegger_ and _an Actor with the name Al Pacino_, the concepts _Movie_ and _Terminator_ will find a closer relation to the first actor rather than the latter. |
| **Contextionary** | Derived from *dictionary* with *context*. Pre-trained vector space which contains vectors for nearly all words used in a specific language. The Contextionary (text2vec-contextionary) gives context to the language used in the dataset, inspired by the [*Global Vectors for Word Representation*](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) concept. Read more about the Contextionary [here](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-contextionary.md). |
| **Entity** | An entity refers to something -often- in the world around us. E.g., _a Company with the name Apple_ refers to an entity with a relation to _a Product with the name iPhone_. Weaviate's Contextionary tries to find as many entities in your data as possible. |
| **Fuzzy** | Opposed to most other data solutions, Weaviate uses [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) to interpret a query. The upside of this is that it might find answers to queries where a traditional data solution might not. |
| **HNSW** | Hierarchical Navigable Small World - a multilayered graph vector index type. |
| **Inverted index** | An index storing a mapping from data property values, to its locations of data objects in a database (named in contrast to a forward index, which maps from data objects to property data values). |
| **Property** | All classes have properties. E.g., the class Company might have the property _name_. In Weaviate, properties can be recognized because they always have a lowercase first character. |
| **Schema** | In Weaviate, a schema is used to define the types of data you will be adding and querying. You can learn more about it [here](../starter-guides/schema.md). |
| **Weaviate Cluster** | A managed Weaviate cluster |
| **[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/)** | WCD is our SaaS for providing cloud instances of Weaviate |
| **Vector index** | A data storage mechanism where data is stored as vectors (long arrays of numbers, also seen as coordinates in a high dimensional space), allowing for context-based search |
