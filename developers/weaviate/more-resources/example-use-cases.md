This page illustrates various use cases for [vector databases](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) by way of open-source demo projects. You can fork and modify any of them.

If you would like to contribute your own project to this page, create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-io/issues).

## Similarity search

A vector databases enables fast, efficient similarity searches on and across any modalities, such as text or images, as well as their combinations. Vector database' similarity search capabilities can be used for other complex use cases, such as recommendation systems in classical machine learning applications.

## LLMs and search

Vector databases and LLMs go together like cookies and milk!

Vector databases help to address some of large language models (LLMs) limitations, such as hallucinations, by helping to retrieve the relevant information to provide to the LLM as a part of its input.

## Classification

Weaviate can leverage its vectorization capabilities to enable automatic, real-time classification of unseen, new concepts based on its semantic understanding.

|Title | Description | Modality | Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Audio Genre Classification | Classify the music genre of an audio file. | Image | [Python](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/DEMO-classification-audio-genre/) |

## Other use cases

Weaviate's [modular ecosystem](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules) unlocks many other use cases of the Weaviate vector database, such as [Named Entity Recognition](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/ner-transformers) or [spell checking](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/other-modules/spellcheck).
