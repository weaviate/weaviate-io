This page illustrates various use cases for [vector databases](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) by way of open-source demo projects. You can fork and modify any of them.

If you would like to contribute your own project to this page, please let us know by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-io/issues).

:::info
During October 1-31, 2023, we are hosting a community sprint to onboard engineers and machine learning practitioners to their first open source contribution.

Demos that are marked with a pumpkin üéÉ sign are looking for contributions. For more info, checkout the [Hacktoberfest 2023 blog post](https://weaviate.io/blog/hacktoberfest-2023).

## Similarity search

A vector databases enables fast, efficient similarity searches on and across any modalities, such as text or images, as well as their combinations. Vector database' similarity search capabilities can be used for other complex use cases, such as recommendation systems in classical machine learning applications.

## LLMs and search

Vector databases and LLMs go together like cookies and milk!

Vector databases help to address some of large language models (LLMs) limitations, such as hallucinations, by helping to retrieve the relevant information to provide to the LLM as a part of its input.

|Title | Description | Subcategory | Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Verba, the golden RAGtriever ([Demo](https://verba.weaviate.io/)) | Chat with Weaviate documentation and blog posts. | Retrieval-Augmented Generation | [Python](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba) |
| HealthSearch ([Blog](https://weaviate.io/blog/healthsearch-demo), [Demo](https://healthsearch-frontend.onrender.com/)) | Recommendation system of health products based on symptoms. | Generative search  | [Python](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo) |
| AirBnB Listings ([Blog](https://weaviate.io/blog/generative-feedback-loops-with-llms)) | Generation of customized advertisements for AirBnB listings. | Generative feedback loops | [Python](https://github.com/weaviate/Generative-Feedback-Loops/) |
| Distyll | Summarize text or video content. | tbd | [Python](https://github.com/databyjp/distyll) |

## Classification

Weaviate can leverage its vectorization capabilities to enable automatic, real-time classification of unseen, new concepts based on its semantic understanding.

|Title | Category | Modality | Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| üéÉ Toxic Comment Classification | Clasify whether a comment is toxic or non-toxic. | Text | [Python](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/DEMO-classification-toxic-comment) |
| üéÉ Audio Genre Classification | Classify the music genre of an audio file. | Image | [Python](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/DEMO-classification-audio-genre/) |

## Other use cases

Weaviate's [modular ecosystem](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules) unlocks many other use cases of the Weaviate vector database, such as [Named Entity Recognition](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/ner-transformers) or [spell checking](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/other-modules/spellcheck).
