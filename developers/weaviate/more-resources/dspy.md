[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is a framework for programming language models created by Stanford NLP. DSPy introduces two key concepts: **programming model** and **optimizers**.

- **Programing model**: The programming model lets you define a series of components that make a language model request. Components include input and output fields, task descriptions, and calls to a vector database like Weaviate.

- **Optimizers**: Optimizers compile your DSPy program to tune the language model prompt and/or the weights.

## DSPy and Weaviate

Weaviate is integrated with DSPy through the retriever model! You only need to connect to your Weaviate cluster through [WCD](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) or localhost, and pass in your collection:

```python
weaviate_client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080") # or pass in your WCD cluster url

retriever_model = WeaviateRM("WeaviateBlogChunk", # collection name
                    weaviate_client=weaviate_client)
```

## Our Resources 
Here are a few resources on using DSPy from the Weaviate team!

The resources are broken into two categories: 
1. [**Hands on Learning**](#hands-on-learning): Content framed to build your technical understanding with end-to-end tutorials. 

2. [**Read and Listen**](#read-and-listen): Content designed to help develop your conceptual understanding of these technologies.
