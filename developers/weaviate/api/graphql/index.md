## API

Weaviate offers [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and gRPC APIs for queries.

We recommend using a Weaviate [client library](../../client-libraries/index.md), which abstracts away the underlying API calls and makes it easier to integrate Weaviate into your application.

However, you can query Weaviate directly using GraphQL with a POST request to the `/graphql` endpoint, or write your own `gRPC` calls based on the [gRPC](../grpc.md) protobuf specification.

## GraphQL API

### Why GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language built on using graph data structures. It is an efficient method of data retrieval and mutation, since it mitigates the common over-fetching and under-fetching problems of other query languages.

:::tip GraphQL is case-sensitive
GraphQL is case-sensitive ([reference](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names)), so make sure to use the correct casing when writing your queries.

### Query structure

You can POST a GraphQL query to Weaviate as follows:

```bash
curl http://localhost/v1/graphql -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{GraphQL query}'
```

A GraphQL JSON object is defined as:

```json
{
    "query": "{ # GRAPHQL QUERY }"
}
```

GraphQL queries follow a defined structure. Queries are structured as follows:


```graphql
{
  <Function> {
      <Collection> {
        <property>
        _<underscore-property>
      }
  }
}
```

### Limitations

GraphQL _integer_ data currently only supports `int32`, and does not support `int64`. This means that currently _integer_ data fields in Weaviate with integer values larger than `int32`, will not be returned using GraphQL queries. We are working on solving this [issue](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/1563). As current workaround is to use a `string` instead.

### Consistency level

GraphQL (`Get`) queries are run with a tunable [consistency level](../../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#tunable-read-consistency).

## gRPC API

Starting with Weaviate v1.19.0, a gRPC interface is being progressively added to Weaviate.

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that is contract-based and can be used in any environment. It is based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, and is therefore very fast and efficient.

Read more about the gRPC API [here](../grpc.md).
