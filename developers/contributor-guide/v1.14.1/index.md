## How to contribute
There's roughly two ways you can contribute to the development of Weaviate: 
1. By directly contributing to the open source code in Github, or
2. By using, testing, sharing, giving feedback and proposing ideas via one of our communication channels.

This guide contains information on our development philosophy, standards, tips and benchmarks of Weaviate and its tools (e.g. Contextionary and Clients). You can start contributing by for example looking at [good first issues](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/labels/good-first-issue).

But also if you're not here to contribute in code, you help Weaviate improve and grow by testing and giving us feedback through creating [issues](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues), asking questions on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/weaviate) or in the [community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/weaviate/shared_invite/zt-goaoifjr-o8FuVz9b1HLzhlUfyfddhw).
