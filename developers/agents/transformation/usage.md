The Weaviate Transformation Agent is an agentic service designed to augment and transform data using foundation models. Use the Transformation Agent to append new properties and/or update existing properties of data on existing objects in Weaviate.

This can help you to improve the quality of your objects in your Weaviate collections, ready for further use in your applications.

## Prerequisites

### Weaviate instance

This Agent is available exclusively for use with a Weaviate Cloud instance.

Refer to the [Weaviate Cloud documentation](/developers/wcs/index.mdx) for more information on how to set up a Weaviate Cloud instance.

You can try this Weaviate Agent with a free Sandbox instance on [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).

### Client library

:::note Supported languages
At this time, the Query Agent is available only for Python. Support for other languages will be added in the future.
:::

You can install the Weaviate client library with the optional `agents` extras to use Weaviate Agents. This will install the `weaviate-agents` package along with the `weaviate-client` package.

Install the client library using the following command:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">

```shell
pip install -U weaviate-client[agents]
```

#### Troubleshooting: Force `pip` to install the latest version

For existing installations, even `pip install -U "weaviate-client[agents]"` may not upgrade `weaviate-agents` to the [latest version](https://pypi.org/project/weaviate-agents/). If this occurs, additionally try to explicitly upgrade the `weaviate-agents` package:

```shell
pip install -U weaviate-agents
```

Or install a [specific version](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-agents-python-client/tags):

```shell
pip install -U weaviate-agents==||site.weaviate_agents_version||
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Usage

To use the Transformation Agent, instantiate it with the required inputs and start the operations.

Transformation operations are asynchronous. Each operation will return a workflow ID to the user. Use this ID to check its status.

Example usage is shown below.

### Prerequisites

The Transformation Agent is tightly integrated with Weaviate Cloud. As a result, the Transformation Agent is available exclusively for use with a Weaviate Cloud instance, and a supported version of the client library.

### Connect to Weaviate

You must connect to the Weaviate Cloud instance to use the Transformation Agent. Connect to the Weaviate Cloud instance using the Weaviate client library.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PyCode}
            startMarker="# START ConnectToWeaviate"
            endMarker="# END ConnectToWeaviate"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Define transformation operations

You must define transformation operations before starting the Transformation Agent. Define operations with the following information:

- Operation type
- Target property name
- The properties to be used as context
- Instructions
- (For new properties) The data type of the new property

Example operations are shown below.

#### Append new properties to data

New properties can be appended to objects based on existing property values and user instructions.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PyCode}
            startMarker="# START DefineOperationsAppend"
            endMarker="# END DefineOperationsAppend"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Update existing properties

Values of existing properties can be updated on objects based on existing property values and user instructions.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PyCode}
            startMarker="# START DefineOperationsUpdate"
            endMarker="# END DefineOperationsUpdate"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Start the transformation operations

To start the transformation operations, instantiate the Transformation Agent with the required inputs and start the operations.

Instantiate the Transformation Agent with the Weaviate client, the target collection name, and the list of transformation operations.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PyCode}
            startMarker="# START StartTransformationOperations"
            endMarker="# END StartTransformationOperations"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Monitor job status

You can use the workflow ID to monitor the status of each transformation operation.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PyCode}
            startMarker="# START MonitorJobStatus"
            endMarker="# END MonitorJobStatus"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
