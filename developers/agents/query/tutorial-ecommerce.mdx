In this tutorial, we will be building a simple e-commerce assistant agent with the **[Weaviate Query Agent](./index.md)**. This agent will have access to multiple Weaviate collections, and will be capable of answering complex queries about brands and clothing items, accessing information from each collection.

We've prepared a few public datasets that you can use to explore the Query Agent.
They are available on HuggingFace:

- [**E-Commerce:**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/query-agent-ecommerce) A dataset that lists clothing items, prices, brands, reviews, etc.
- [**Brands:**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/query-agent-brands) A dataset that lists clothing brands and information about them, such as their parent brand, child brands, average customer rating, etc.

## Introduction: What are Query Agents?

The Weaviate Query Agent is a pre-built agentic service designed to answer natural language queries based on the data stored in Weaviate Cloud. The user simply provides a prompt/question in natural language, and the Query Agent takes care of all intervening steps to provide an answer.

      />
    </div>
  </div>

<br />

The Query Agent:

1. **Receives a task** in the form of a question or instructions.
2. **Uses an appropriate generative model** (e.g. large language model) to analyze the task and determine the exact queries to perform.
3. **Sends the queries to Weaviate**, which vectorizes the queries as needed using the specified vectorizer integration (we will use Weaviate Embeddings).
4. **Receives the results from Weaviate** and uses appropriate generative models to generate the final response to the user prompt/query.

<hr />

## Prerequisites

To use the Weaviate Agents and Weaviate Embedding service, you need to have a **[Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)** account.

## Step 1: Set up Weaviate

Now, let's get started by setting up a Weaviate Cloud instance that we will use for this tutorial and connecting it to the Python client.

### 1.1 Create a Weaviate Cloud cluster

1. Create a [free Sandbox cluster](/developers/wcs/manage-clusters/create#sandbox-clusters) in Weaviate Cloud.
1. Take note of the `REST Endpoint` and `Admin` API key to connect to your cluster. (for more info, check out the [quickstart](/developers/wcs/quickstart#22-connect-to-your-weaviate-cloud-instance))

:::tip
In this tutorial, we are using the [Weaviate Embeddings](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/model-providers/weaviate) service as the vectorizer, so you do not have to provide any extra keys for external embedding providers. Weaviate Embeddings uses the `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` as the default embedding model.<br/><br/>
If you want to use another vectorizer, check out the list of supported [model providers](../../weaviate/model-providers/index.md).
:::

### 1.2 Install the Python libraries

In order to install the Weaviate Python client together with the `agents` component, run:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">

```
pip install "weaviate-client[agents]"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will also need `datasets`, a lightweight library providing access to the publicly hosted datasets on HuggingFace.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py_agents" label="Python">

```
pip install datasets
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

import ForcePipInstall from '../_includes/_force_pip_install.mdx';

<ForcePipInstall />

### 1.3 Connect to your instance

Now, you can finally connect to your Weaviate Cloud instance with the parameters from the first step:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START ConnectToWeaviate"
      endMarker="# END ConnectToWeaviate"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After running this snippet, you should see the message `True` printed out, which means that you have successfully connected to your instance.

## Step 2: Prepare the Collections

In the following code blocks, we are pulling our demo datasets from Hugging Face and writing them to new collections in our Weaviate Sandbox cluster. Before we can start importing the data into Weaviate, we need to **define the collections**, which means setting up the data schema and choosing the vectorizer/embedding service.

### 2.1 Define the Collections

Below you can see what the objects in the datasets `E-Commerce` and `Brands` look like.

import WeaviateAgentsEcommerceDataset from '/developers/agents/_includes/query_agent_tutorial_ecommerce_dataset.png';

<div class="row">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card__image">
      <img
        src={WeaviateAgentsEcommerceDataset}
        alt="The E-Commerce and Brands datasets"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

For the collection `Brands`, we are going to use the [`auto-schema`](../../weaviate/config-refs/schema/index.md#auto-schema) option which creates properties automatically based on the imported data.
However, this is not the best way of importing the data.

The Query Agent uses the **descriptions of collections and properties** to decide which ones to use when solving queries. You can experiment by changing these descriptions and providing more details.
This is why it's recommended to manually define the data schema and add the property descriptions.

For example, below we make sure that the Query Agent knows that prices are all in USD, which is information that would otherwise be unavailable.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START DefineCollections"
      endMarker="# END DefineCollections"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2.2 Populate the database

Now, we can import the pre-vectorized data ([E-Commerce](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/query-agent-ecommerce) and [Brands](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/query-agent-brands)) into our Weaviate Cloud instance:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START PopulateDatabase"
      endMarker="# END PopulateDatabase"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

By calling `len()` on our collections, we can check that the import has successfully concluded and see what the size of our collections is.

```
Size of the E-Commerce dataset: 448
Size of the Brands dataset: 104
```

## Step 3: Set up the Query Agent

### 3.1 Basic Query Agent

When setting up the query agent, we have to provide a few things:

- The `client`
- The `collection` which we want the agent to have access to.
- (Optionally) A `system_prompt` that describes how our agent should behave
- (Optionally) Timeout - which for now defaults to 60s.

Let's start with a simple agent. Here, we're creating an `agent` that has access to our `Brands` and `ECommerce` datasets.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START BasicQueryAgent"
      endMarker="# END BasicQueryAgent"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And that's about it! Now, you can start using the Query Agent.

### 3.2 Customized Query Agent (with system prompt) {#system-prompt-agent}

In some cases, you may want to define a custom `system_prompt` for your agent. This can help you provide the agent with some default instructions for how to behave. For example, let's create an agent that will always answer the query in the user's language.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START CustomizedQueryAgent"
      endMarker="# END CustomizedQueryAgent"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We will use this custom agent `multi_lingual_agent` in [step 4.5](#use-system-prompt-agent).

## Step 4: Run the Query Agent

When we run the agent, it will first make a few decisions depending on the query:

1. The agent will decide which collection (or multiple collections) to look up an answer in.
2. The agent will also decide whether to perform a regular **_search query_**, what **_filters_** to use, whether to do an **_aggregation query_**, or all of them together.
3. It will then provide a response within **`QueryAgentResponse`**.

### 4.1 Ask a question

Let's start with a simple question:

- "I like vintage clothes, can you list me some options that are less than $200?"

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START AskQuestions"
      endMarker="# END AskQuestions"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response from the agent is:

```
original_query='I like vintage clothes, can you list me some options that are less than $200?' collection_names=['ECommerce'] searches=[[QueryResultWithCollection(queries=['vintage clothes'], filters=[[IntegerPropertyFilter(property_name='price', operator=<ComparisonOperator.LESS_THAN: '<'>, value=200.0)]], filter_operators='AND', collection='ECommerce')]] aggregations=[] usage=Usage(requests=3, request_tokens=7681, response_tokens=428, total_tokens=8109, details=None) total_time=11.588264226913452 aggregation_answer=None has_aggregation_answer=False has_search_answer=True is_partial_answer=False missing_information=[] final_answer='Here are some vintage-inspired clothing options under $200:\n\n1. **Vintage Philosopher Midi Dress ($125.00)** - A deep green velvet fabric dress with antique gold button detailing, perfect for an academic or sophisticated setting. [Echo & Stitch]\n\n2. **Vintage Gale Pleated Dress ($120.00)** - A burgundy pleated dress capturing the Dark Academia aesthetic, great for poetry readings or contemplative afternoons.

[Vivid Verse]\n\n7. **Vintage Ivy Loafers ($120.00)** - Burgundy leather loafers offering timeless sophistication, suitable for academic settings. [Solemn Chic]' sources=[Source(object_id='6040c373-9cce-421d-8f4e-e01346cbf29f', collection='ECommerce'), Source(object_id='06a83da4-92ff-4cbc-9cc6-c55fc6ed49b9', collection='ECommerce'), Source(object_id='a5a0927d-2859-47e6-8455-d77e0190aa53', collection='ECommerce'), Source(object_id='a5f3c394-d207-4064-a2bc-b9f655d09ddc', collection='ECommerce'), Source(object_id='5d7bb719-2df5-4a7c-9bbc-275450ab29c6', collection='ECommerce'), Source(object_id='50f4c89c-faf9-4430-b393-c39ede5d511d', collection='ECommerce'), Source(object_id='5b6d5a1f-e218-4400-ac9f-df59466f3c97', collection='ECommerce')]
```

But this output is a bit too much, so let's just return the field `final_answer`:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START FinalAnswerAskQuestions"
      endMarker="# END FinalAnswerAskQuestions"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output is:

```
Here are some vintage-inspired clothing options under $200:

1. **Vintage Philosopher Midi Dress ($125.00)** - A deep green velvet fabric dress with antique gold button detailing, perfect for an academic or sophisticated setting. [Echo & Stitch]

2. **Vintage Gale Pleated Dress ($120.00)** - A burgundy pleated dress capturing the Dark Academia aesthetic, great for poetry readings or contemplative afternoons. [Solemn Chic]

3. **Retro Groove Flared Pants ($59.00)** - Electric blue flared pants capturing early 2000s millennial pop culture chic. [Vivid Verse]

4. **Vintage Scholar Tote ($90.00)** - A deep green canvas tote with brown leather accents, ideal for carrying scholarly essentials. [Echo & Stitch]

5. **Retro Futura Tee ($29.98)** - A bold graphic tee with early 2000s pop culture references, perfect for a nostalgic throwback. [Vivid Verse]

### 4.5 Use a system prompt {#use-system-prompt-agent}

We are going to use the custom agent from [step 3.2](#system-prompt-agent) with the system prompt that says:

```
"You are a helpful assistant that always generates the final response in the user's language."
"You may have to translate the user query to perform searches. But you must always respond to the user in their own language."
```

For example, try to ask if the brand "Eko & Stitch" has a branch or associated company in the UK but using Japanese instead of English:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START MoreQuestions"
      endMarker="# END MoreQuestions"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>The response is:</summary>

```
Eko & Stitchは、英国に拠点があります。1974年に設立され、品質の高いクラフトマンシップとタイムレスなエレガンスで知られています。関連ブランドとして「Eko & Stitch Active」と「Eko & Stitch Kids」があります。また、Eko & Stitchの親会社はNova Nestです。
```

Or translated to English:

```
Eko & Stitch is based in the UK. It was established in 1974 and is known for its high-quality craftsmanship and timeless elegance. It has associated brands, "Eko & Stitch Active" and "Eko & Stitch Kids." Additionally, the parent company of Eko & Stitch is Nova Nest.

## Summary

This guide shows you how to build an end-to-end e-commerce assistant using Weaviate's agentic services — from setting up your Weaviate Cloud instance and importing datasets to configuring a Query Agent that intelligently handles natural language queries.

The Query Agent automatically interprets queries to decide whether to run standard searches, filters, or aggregations. It connects to multiple collections and selects the right source based on your query. The agent can also use previous interactions to provide more relevant follow-up answers and you can define system prompts to ensure the agent always responds in the user’s preferred language or style.
