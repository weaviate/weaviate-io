[Dynamiq](https://www.getdynamiq.ai/) is an operating platform for building agentic AI applications.
 

## Dynamiq and Weaviate
Weaviate is a [supported document retriever](https://docs.getdynamiq.ai/low-code-builder/rag-nodes/inference-rag-workflow/document-retrievers#weaviate-retriever) in Dynamiq. The integration allows you to `read` and `write` to your Weaviate cluster to build robust RAG applications.
