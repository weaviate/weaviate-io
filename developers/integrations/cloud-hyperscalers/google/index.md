Launch a Weaviate cluster from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) marketplace. Weaviate integrates with Google AI Studio and Google Vertex AI.

## GCP and Weaviate 
Weaviate integrates with GCP infrastructure and services like Google [AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en).

* [Deploy Weaviate on GCP Marketplace](/developers/weaviate/installation/gc-marketplace)
* [Run embedding and generative models on Vertex AI and AI Studio](/developers/weaviate/model-providers/google)


## Our Resources 
The resources are broken into two categories: 
1. [**Hands on Learning**](#hands-on-learning): Build your technical understanding with end-to-end tutorials.

2. [**Read and Listen**](#read-and-listen): Develop your conceptual understanding of these technologies.
