[Box](https://www.box.com/home) is a cloud-based content management platform that enables organizations to securely store, share, and collaborate on files.

## Box and Weaviate
By connecting Box with Weaviate, you can transform your stored files into a powerful semantic search system or enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This setup allows for advanced retrieval and AI-driven content generation based on your Box documents.
