[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) is a platform that allows users to run machine learning models through a cloud API. They host many open-source models, including embedding and language models. Users can run or fine-tune the models to meet their application needs.

## Replicate and Weaviate
To use models on Replicate, you need to use [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/llms/replicate/) or [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/llms/replicate/) and connect it to your Weaviate vector store.
