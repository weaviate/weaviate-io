[Modal](https://modal.com/) provides a serverless platform that has on-demand access to GPUs and a custom high-performance container runtime. Use Modal to easily deploy and automatically scale high-performance applications.

## Modal and Weaviate
Weaviate leverages Modal's serverless infrastructure for fast embedding generation and for fast generative model calls.

To dynamically scale your application based on workload demands, [host the Weaviate client](https://modal.com/docs/examples/vector-analogies-wikipedia#deploy-a-serverless-read-only-weaviate-client-with-modal) on Modal.
