## About the Categories
The ecosystem is divided into these categories:

* **Cloud Hyperscalers** - Large-scale computing and storage
* **Compute Infrastructure** - Run and scale containerized applications
* **Data Platforms** - Data ingestion and web scraping 
* **LLM and Agent Frameworks** - Build agents and generative AI applications
* **Operations** - Tools for monitoring and analyzing generative AI workflows
