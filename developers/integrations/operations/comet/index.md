[Comet](https://www.comet.com/site/) is a centralized platform that allows you to track, evaluate, and monitor both traditional and LLM models end-to-end.

## Comet and Weaviate
For teams working on training and fine-tuning LLMs, Cometâ€™s Experiment Tracking solution can first be used to track any LLM fine-tuning runs in a reproducible way, and easily share with the team.

Once you have a model that you want to move forward with, whether that is a fine tuned OS model or a proprietary model, you will need to evaluate how that model performs with different datasets, RAGs, prompt templates, and other input tweaks before moving your application to production.
