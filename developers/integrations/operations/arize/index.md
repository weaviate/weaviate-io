[Arize AI](https://arize.com/) created Phoenix, an open-source tool for tracing and evaluation.

## Arize and Weaviate
You can use [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to log search queries sent to Weaviate and requests sent to LLM providers in Phoenix.

Phoenix provides a data visualization UI and additional APIs for accessing logged data.
