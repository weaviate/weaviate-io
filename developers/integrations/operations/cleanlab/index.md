[Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/) provides software to detect and remediate inaccurate responses from Enterprise AI applications. It ensures your Agents, RAG, and Chatbots are safe and helpful.

## Cleanlab and Weaviate
For any RAG solution built using Weaviate technology (knowledge base, embeddings, etc) and any LLM model, Cleanlab will automatically score the trustworthiness of each RAG response. 

This enables you to automatically flag inaccurate/hallucinated responses and avoid losing your usersâ€™ trust.
