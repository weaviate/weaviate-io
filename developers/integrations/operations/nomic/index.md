[Nomic AI's](https://www.nomic.ai/) Atlas uses algorithms such as t-SNE, UMAP, or PCA to reduce high-dimensional vectors into 2 or 3 dimensions. The lower dimensional vectors are useful for visualizing vector embeddings. 

## Nomic and Weaviate 
Connect Nomic to your Weaviate cluster to visualize the embeddings in your collection.
