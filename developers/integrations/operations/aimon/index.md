[AIMon](https://www.aimon.ai/) offers monitoring and reranking tools to evaluate, optimize, and improve LLM applications.


## AIMon and Weaviate
AIMon integrates with Weaviate by enhancing vector search results using its low-latency, domain-adaptable reranker. 

Users can compute a composite quality score across retrieved resultsâ€”combining hallucination, instruction adherence, and retrieval relevance metrics.
