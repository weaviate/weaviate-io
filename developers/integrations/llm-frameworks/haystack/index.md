[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) is a framework for building large language model applications.

## Haystack and Weaviate
Weaviate is a [supported document store](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/weaviate-document-store) in Haystack. You need a running Weaviate cluster to build the document store. 

```python
auth_client_secret = AuthApiKey(Secret.from_token("MY_WEAVIATE_API_KEY"))
document_store = WeaviateDocumentStore(auth_client_secret=auth_client_secret)
```
