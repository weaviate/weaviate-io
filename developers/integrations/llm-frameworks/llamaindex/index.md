[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is a framework for building large language model (LLM) applications. 

## LlamaIndex and Weaviate
Weaviate is a [supported vector store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/storage/vector_store/weaviate/) in LlamaIndex. 

Create a vector store:

```python
vector_store = WeaviateVectorStore(weaviate_client=client, index_name="LlamaIndex")
```

## Our Resources 
The resources are broken into two categories: 
1. [**Hands on Learning**](#hands-on-learning): Build your technical understanding with end-to-end tutorials.

2. [**Read and Listen**](#read-and-listen): Develop your conceptual understanding of these technologies.
