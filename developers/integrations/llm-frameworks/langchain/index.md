[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) is a framework for building applications that use large language models (LLMs).

## LangChain and Weaviate
Weaviate is a supported [vector store](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate/#step-1-data-import) in LangChain. You will need a running Weaviate cluster to use the integration.

Connect LangChain to your Weaviate cluster:
```python
weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_local()
db = WeaviateVectorStore.from_documents(docs, embeddings, client=weaviate_client)
```

## Our Resources
The resources are broken into two categories:
1. [**Hands on Learning**](#hands-on-learning): Build your technical understanding with end-to-end tutorials.

2. [**Read and Listen**](#read-and-listen): Develop your conceptual understanding of these technologies.
