[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/) is an LLM framework developed by Microsoft. Semantic Kernel facilitates building LLM applications with abstractions such as `plugins`, `memory`, `planners`, and more! 

## Semantic Kernel and Weaviate
Weaviate is a supported vector store in Semantic Kernel. 


## Our Resources 
The resources are broken into two categories: 
1. [**Hands on Learning**](#hands-on-learning): Build your technical understanding with end-to-end tutorials.

2. [**Read and Listen**](#read-and-listen): Develop your conceptual understanding of these technologies.

### Hands on Learning

| Topic | Description | Resource | 
| --- | --- | --- |
|  RAG Chatbot with Semantic Kernel | Implements a simple workflow of retrieve-then-generate. Use a semantic kernel for prompt engineering, orchestrating OpenAI API calls, and integrating Weaviate. Use Weavate as a knowledge base to retrieve semantically relevant context. | [Notebook](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/llm-frameworks/semantic-kernel/dotnet/Chatbot_RAG_Weaviate.ipynb) |
| Retrieval Augmented Generation using Weaviate and SK | Implements a simple workflow of retrieve-then-generate. | [Notebook](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/llm-frameworks/semantic-kernel/RetrievalAugmentedGeneration_Weaviate.ipynb) |
| Weaviate Persistent Memory | This notebook shows how to replace `VolatileMemoryStore` memory storage with a `WeaviateMemoryStore` persistent memory. | [Notebook](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/llm-frameworks/semantic-kernel/weaviate-persistent-memory.ipynb) |
