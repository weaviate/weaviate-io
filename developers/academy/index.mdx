## Units
-----

:::info
A **unit** covers a single topic, for example to teach a particular concept, skill, or a mix of both. A unit might:

- Explain a concept, such as what vector search is, how to select a vectorizer, or what to consider when scaling Weaviate to production
- Teach a skill such as how to use queries, import data or add authentication in Weaviate
- Use a combination of both, such as by explaining the role of a schema and how to build one

Units are often used within the context of a course, however there may also be 'standalone' units that are not found in any courses.
