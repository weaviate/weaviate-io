Hi there! Welcome back. In this unit, you will learn about the most commonly used search capabilities in Weaviate.

You have already seen some examples of vector searches. Here, we will explore different vector search methods available in Weaviate, including `nearVector`, `nearObject`, and `nearText`.

In addition to vector search methods, you'll also learn about filters that can be applied to refine your search results. For example, you will learn how to only search for data objects that do not match certain criteria.

And as we cover these capabilities, we'll also use them as lenses through which we will learn more about the inner workings of Weaviate.

By the end of this unit, you will have a solid understanding of the vector search capabilities in Weaviate, and filtering. This will then lead us well to the next unit, where we will be building a Weaviate instance.

So let's get started.
