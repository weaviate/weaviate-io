## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;About `Aggregate` queries

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

Now that you have seen how to retrieve individual objects with `Get`, let's take a look at how to compile information with `Aggregate`.

`Aggregate` is a powerful function that allows you to combine information from multiple objects into a single result to get a quick overview of the results.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Aggregate` function syntax

![](../../tmp_images/a_person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_at_computer_screen_with_code_0_short.jpg)

While the overall structure of `Aggregate` queries is similar to `Get` queries, there are some important differences as the queries relate to sets of results. The syntax for `Aggregate` queries is as follows:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    <CLASS>, 
).with_group_by_filter(
    <property>
).with_fields(
    "groupedBy {path value}"  # requires `groupBy` argument
    <properties>
).with_meta_count(  # optional
).<arguments>.do()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate (groupBy:[<property>]) {  # `groupBy`: optional argument
    groupedBy {  # requires `groupBy` argument
        path
        value
    }
    meta {  # optional
      count
    }
    <Class> (
      <arguments>
    ) {
      <properties>
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will notice the presence of the `groupBy` argument, This is an optional argument that can be used to group results of the query. The `Aggregate` function can also return metadata about the results, such as the number of results in each group.

Additionally, available properties differ according to data types of the property being queried. For example, the available properties for a `String` property are different from those for an `Integer` property or a cross-reference.

Let's try out some `Aggregate` queries.

As a reminder, our objects include the following schema:

<details>
  <summary>See relevant schema</summary>

import ShortSchema from './_snippets/academy.queries.schema.short.mdx';

<ShortSchema/>

</details>

<!-- ## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Standalone `Aggregate` queries

As we did with `Get` queries, we will begin to look at simple examples of `Aggregate` queries. 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

Take a look at the below query:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    "JeopardyQuestion", 
).with_meta_count().do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion {
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

What do you expect back?

Now, try it out yourself.

This should return something like the below:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "meta": {
            "count": 10000
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

This query aggregates the objects in the `JeopardyQuestion` class to obtain the total count. Since there are no restrictions, it returns the total number of objects which is 10,000. 

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`meta` property

Note that in our `Aggregate` query we specified a sub-property `count` under the requested property `meta`. This is a key difference between `Aggregate` and `Get` queries. 

In `Get` queries, we directly specify a property as the query returns individual objects according to our search criteria. On the other hand, an `Aggregate` query returns a set of results. Accordingly, we must specify a sub-property which can reflect some aspect of the entire set of results, such as the number of entries here.

The `meta` property is available for all data types, and can be used with the `count` sub-property to return the number of retrieved objects. 

<Quiz questions={varName} /> -->

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Aggregate` with `nearText`

We had looked at a few results of a `nearText` query earlier in the earlier section on `Get` queries. We can also use `nearText` in an `Aggregate` query. Take a look:

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

For example, let's say that now instead of individual questions, we would like to know something more holistic about the answers. Like how many questions might be related to this query:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    "JeopardyQuestion", 
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["Intergalactic travel"], "distance": 0.2}
).with_meta_count().do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Intergalactic travel"],
        distance: 0.2
      }
      ) {
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

How do you expect the results to be aggregated? Also, how would the results change as the `distance` parameter changes?

Now, try it out yourself. This query should return something like the below:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "meta": {
            "count": 9
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

This query aggregates the results that were restricted using the `distance` argument. This argument is a threshold that restricts the returned results to those that are relevant to the input. Without it, the search results would potentially include the entire class.

This is called "limiting the search space".

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit search space

In order to produce meaningful aggregations with a vector search, you must limit the search space.

This is different from aggregations in lexical searches, such as those often carried out in relational database. In a relational database, grouping or aggregating data can be done using `groupby` with functions such as SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc. This allows you to find a result set and then aggregate the results.

However, a vector search will return all results as it retrieve results based on *degrees* of similarity. As such, a vector search in itself does not exclude any results from the dataset. Accordingly, an aggregation of a vector search result set will include all results, regardless of the certainty of the match.

Accordingly, the search space must be limited so that only relevant results are included in the aggregation. This can be done by setting an explicit `limit` or a threshold (`distance` or `certainty`) in the query.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`meta` property

Note that in our `Aggregate` query we specified a sub-property `count` under the requested property `meta`. This is a key difference between `Aggregate` and `Get` queries. 

In `Get` queries, we directly specify a property as the query returns individual objects according to our search criteria. On the other hand, an `Aggregate` query returns a set of results. Accordingly, we must specify a sub-property which can reflect some aspect of the entire set of results, such as the number of entries here.

The `meta` property is available for all data types, and can be used with the `count` sub-property to return the number of retrieved objects. 

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try out the above query again, with these changes.
- Change the distance to another value - say, 0.1, 0.19, 0.21, 0.25 - how do the results change?
:::

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Aggregate` with `groupBy`

So far, we have seen how to use `Aggregate` queries to compile information relating one set of results. This can be extended with the `groupBy` argument to compile information from multiple, subsets of results.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

For example, let's say we want to know how many questions there are for each available `value` property. We can do this by adding the `groupBy` argument to the query:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    "JeopardyQuestion", 
).with_group_by_filter(
    "round"
).with_fields(
    "groupedBy {path value}"
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["Intergalactic travel"], "distance": 0.2}
).with_meta_count().do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Intergalactic travel"],
        distance: 0.2
      }      
      groupBy: ["round"]
      ) {
      groupedBy {
        path
        value
      }
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

What do you expect to see here? How will the results differ, now that we've added the `groupBy` argument? Do you notice what else has changed to the query?

Now, try it out yourself. This query should return something like the below:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "groupedBy": {
            "path": [
              "round"
            ],
            "value": "Double Jeopardy!"
          },
          "meta": {
            "count": 5
          }
        },
        {
          "groupedBy": {
            "path": [
              "round"
            ],
            "value": "Jeopardy!"
          },
          "meta": {
            "count": 3
          }
        },
        {
          "groupedBy": {
            "path": [
              "round"
            ],
            "value": "Final Jeopardy!"
          },
          "meta": {
            "count": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

This query supplies an additional `groupedBy` argument, as a result of which the counts are of each `round`. The query also requests `groupedBy` a property so that each count is identifiable by the `value` of each `round` group.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`groupBy` + `groupedBy`

Results identified by an `Aggregate` query can be further grouped by using a `groupBy` argument. This argument takes a list of properties as an argument, and will group the results by the values of those properties.

This is a particularly useful query pattern for identifying characteristics for subsets of results of a vector search. 

When the `groupBy` argument is used, additional property `groupedBy` is made available. This property and its sub-properties can be used to identify the group that the result belongs to.

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try out the above query again, with these changes.
- Instead of `round` try grouping by the `points` property.
- Instead of `distance`, try adding an `.with_object_limit(9)` in the method chain. Are the results the same?
:::

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-properties for `Aggregate`

As we have seen, the `meta` property is available for all data types, and can be used with the `count` sub-property to return the number of retrieved objects.

In addition to this, there are a number of other sub-properties that can be used with `Aggregate` queries. Their availability, however, depend on the data type that is being queried.

Let's take a look at some of these sub-properties, based on the `Question` class. 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

Try the following query:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    "JeopardyQuestion", 
).with_fields(
    "round {type topOccurrences {value occurs}}"
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["Intergalactic travel"]}
).with_object_limit(10).with_meta_count().do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Intergalactic travel"],
        distance: 0.2
      }   
      ) {
      meta {
        count
      }
      round {
        type
        topOccurrences {
          value
          occurs
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Take a note of the requested properties in the GraphQL query, and consider what types of values they might return. How might these properties change according to the nature of the source data?

Now, try it out yourself. This query should return something like the below:

              }
            ],
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

The sub-properties under `round` in the query requests additional aggregations here, resulting in the top occurring answers being returned as well as their counts.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available sub-properties

Sub-properties allow further granular aggregations of data from Weaviate. These properties that can be queried will vary according to the data type that is being aggregated.

Along with the `string` data type, `text` properties may be queried to retrieve one or more of:

- count
- type
- topOccurrences

However, `int` data types, for example, can be aggregated to retrieve:

- count
- type
- minimum
- maximum
- mean
- median
- mode
- sum

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try out the above query again, with these changes.
- Can you aggregate the results based on the data from the `answer` property?
- Try modifying the query to group the results by `round`, and then aggregate top occurrences from `answer`.
