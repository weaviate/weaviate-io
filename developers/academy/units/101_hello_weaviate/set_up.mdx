## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Options for running Weaviate

You can run Weaviate as a managed service (Weaviate Cloud Services, or WCS), or manage your own instances using Docker, Kubernetes, or Embedded Weaviate.

As mentioned before, the underlying Weaviate code is identical regardless of the method. There are some differences to be aware of.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;WCS (Recommended)

[WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.cloud/), is a managed SaaS service that requires no maintenance at your end.

As it is managed by Weaviate (the company - the software is not sentient... *yet*), it is the fastest way to create a new instance of Weaviate and requires the least amount of effort for the users.

Weaviate instances on WCS come pre-configured for convenience. They include a number of Weaviate "modules" by default, as well as built-in support for user authentication for security.

WCS includes a free "sandbox" tier, which is our recommend method of running Weaviate throughout this course unless otherwise specified.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker / Kubernetes

You can run Weaviate instances using containerization solutions such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and/or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

This provides you with the same code base as one that is used in WCS, although you will need to manage its configuration and deployment yourself.

Self-managed set ups using Docker or Kubernetes will be discussed in standalone, separate units in the future.

If you are familiar with either solutions and would prefer to install Weaviate through them, we refer you to our documentation for installation with [Docker-Compose](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Embedded Weaviate

We also have an experimental feature called [Embedded Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded.md), where you can directly instantiate a Weaviate database from a client library.

It is however in an experimental phase only, and is not recommended for anything other than evaluation.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get started with WCS

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign in to WCS

1. First, access WCS by navigating to the [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud), and click on "Sign in with the Weaviate Cloud Services".
    1. If you don't have an account with WCS yet, click on the "Register" button and create a new account.
1. Then, sign in with your WCS username and password.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a Weaviate Cluster

To create a new Weaviate Cluster, click the "Create cluster" button.

<img src={WCScreateButton} width="100%" alt="Button to create WCS instance"/>

Then:

1. Select the **Free sandbox** *plan tier*.
1. Provide a *cluster name*, which will become a part of its URL. A suffix will be added to this to ensure uniqueness.
1. Set the `Enable Authentication?` option to `NO`.

Your selections should look like this:

<img src={WCSoptions} width="100%" alt="Instance configuration"/>

Finally, press **Create** to create your sandbox instance. Note that the sandbox will expire after a set number of days.

<img src={WCScreate} width="100%" alt="Create instance"/>

This will start the process to create a new instance, and you will see a progress indicator.

<img src={WCScreationProgress} width="100%" alt="Creation in progress"/>

Instance creation should take a minute or two, and you will see a tick ‚úîÔ∏è when it's done, indicating that the instance is ready.

You can communicate with Weaviate with the available [client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md) or directly with the [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/index.md) and the [GraphQL API](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/index.md).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Weaviate client

:::info Academy material in Python
For the initial release of Weaviate Academy units, our materials are written around Python examples.<br/><br/>
But we are working to add versions for other clients, starting with TypeScript/JavaScript examples. We appreciate your patience as we build up our educational material.
:::

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available clients

Currently, Weaviate clients are available in:

- <i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> Python
- <i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> TypeScript/JavaScript
- <i class="fa-brands fa-java"></i> Java
- <i class="fa-brands fa-golang"></i> Go
