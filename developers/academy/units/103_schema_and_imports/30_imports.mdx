### Sources of vectors

Weaviate provides multiple ways for users to associate vector representations with objects. In general, users can either use Weaviate's vectorizer modules to obtain vector representations during the import process or supply their own vector representations.

#### Using vectorizer modules

If you want to obtain vectors at the time of import, you can use a Weaviate vectorizer module. These modules can be categorized into two groups: those (`text2vec-openai`, `text2vec-cohere`, `text2vec-huggingface`) that call external inference APIs, and those that run locally as a microservice to perform vectorization (e.g. `text2vec-transformers`).

Weaviate's set of vectorizer modules is versatile and extensible. It includes modules for vectorizing text or images, a module that can vectorize both text and images into a single vector space (`multi2vec-clip`), and one that generates vectors based on other vectors (`ref2vec-centroid`).

Custom modules can also be created to extend the capabilities of Weaviate as needed.

#### Uploading vectors

Another option for adding vectors to Weaviate is to manually upload them. This is sometimes referred to as the "Bring Your Own Vector" option in our documentation, and may be a good choice for users who prefer to generate vectors outside of Weaviate or who have already vectorized their data.

:::note Upload vectors and use a vectorizer
It is possible to both upload your own vectors and specify a vectorizer for Weaviate. For example, if you are importing a large dataset and have vectorized the data using a vectorizer that is also available through Weaviate, this may be a useful approach. This will allow you to use Weaviate to vectorize any updates to the dataset, as well as to vectorize queries as necessary.
