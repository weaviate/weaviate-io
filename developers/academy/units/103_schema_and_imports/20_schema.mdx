## Schema definition

### Class definition

### Property definition

#### Data types

Each `class` definition will include one or more properties, which must have a data type. The currently supported data types include the below.

import DataTypes from '/_includes/datatypes.mdx';

<details>
  <summary>Available data types in Weaviate</summary>
  <DataTypes />
</details>

Note that most data types can include one such instance, or a list of instances, such as `string` or `string[]`.

We will look at schema definition including data types in more detail in another unit.
