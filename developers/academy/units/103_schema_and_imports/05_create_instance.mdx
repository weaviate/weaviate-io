## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Weaviate Instance

For this unit, you will require your own instance of Weaviate.

If you do not have one, we recommend setting one up on the Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). Follow the "Get Started with WCS" [section on this page](../101_hello_weaviate/40_set_up.mdx#get-started-with-wcs) and come back.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Access your Weaviate Instance

Now, make sure that you can access your new Weaviate instance by following the below example.

:::tip What is your Weaviate instance address?
Make sure you know what your Weaviate instance address is - it should look like:
```
https://your-instance-name.weaviate.network
```
You can find it in your WCS dashboard.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;With API key authentication (Recommended)

If authentication is on, you can instantiate your client as shown below.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Instantiate Weaviate client w/ auth config ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Instantiate Weaviate client w/ auth config ====="
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Authentication

If authentication is switched off in your instance, you do not need the authentication parameter.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Instantiate Weaviate client w/o auth ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Instantiate Weaviate client w/o auth ====="
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm access

Once your client is instantiated, you can confirm that you can access your Weaviate instance by running the following code:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Confirm that the client can access the instance ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Confirm that the client can access the instance ====="
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
