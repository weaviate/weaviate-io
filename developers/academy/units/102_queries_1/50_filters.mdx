So far, you've seen different query functions such as `Get`, and `Aggregate`, and vector search parameters such as `nearVector`, `nearObject` and `nearText`.

Now, let's take a look at filters.

A filter is a way to specify additional criteria to be applied to the results. There are a number of available filters in Weaviate.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available filters

There exist many available filters, but we do not need to cover them all at this moment. For now, let's explore a few of the most commonly used filters:

- `where`: Apply a Boolean condition to filter the available data.
- `limit`: Restrict the maximum objects to be retrieved.
- `sort`: For sorting non-vector search results.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter data with `where`

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

The `where` filter is analogous to the `WHERE` clause in a SQL query. As in the SQL clause, the `where` filter can be used to apply a boolean conditional to the data.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Single operand example

We ran an example query like this earlier:

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_limit(2).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": "Intergalactic travel"}
).with_additional(
    ["distance", "id"]
).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

Which returned these answers:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.1791926,
            "id": "b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e"
          },
          "answer": "escaping the Earth's gravity (and go off into outer space, on your way to the moon, for instance)",
          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this"
        },
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.18123823,
            "id": "ef263438-b152-5540-97f7-99f4076bd124"
          },
          "answer": "the Milky Way",
          "question": "This is the name of our own galaxy"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

So let's extend our query to now include a `where` argument that uses a `Like` operator.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_limit(2).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": "Intergalactic travel"}
).with_additional(
    ["distance", "id"]
).with_where({
    "path": ["question"],
    "operator": "Like",
    "valueText": "*rocket*"
}).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Intergalactic travel"],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["question"],
        operator: Like,
        valueText: "*rocket*"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Can you guess how you would expect the earlier response to change, if at all?

Here is the actual response:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {

            "id": "ddcc3f06-5410-5944-85c4-3cb56ab27088"
          },

          "question": "He's been called the \"Father of Modern Rocketry\""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

Observe that the results have changed. The previous results have been removed as they do not contain the text `rocket` in the `question` property.

This approach of combining a vector search with a filter is a powerful way to find objects that are similar to a given input, but also meet additional criteria as you see. And while filtering may remove some objects which might otherwise be "closer" to the query vector than the remaining ones, it provides a powerful strategy to find the most relevant objects by removing false positive.

</details>

We can apply the query to filter the data in any number of ways. For example, consider the below query:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer", "points"]
).with_limit(2).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": "Intergalactic travel"}
).with_additional(
    ["distance", "id"]
).with_where({
    "path": ["points"],
    "operator": "GreaterThan",
    "valueInt": 200
}).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
<!-- GraphQL code goes here -->
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Intergalactic travel"],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["points"],
        operator: GreaterThan,
        valueInt: 200
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      points
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

How do you expect that this query will be different to the earlier queries?

        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This query has been modified to only return `JeopardyQuestion` objects with a `points` value greater than 200.

Accordingly, the returned data set is very different.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple operands example

The query syntax can extend to beyond a single operand to take advantage of multiple conditions:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

    ["distance", "id"]
).with_where({
    "operator": "And",
    "operands": [

            "operator": "GreaterThan",
