## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;About `Get` queries

In many use cases, retrieving objects from a Weaviate instance may be the most common operation.

For example, a user may want to retrieve a list of passages most closely related to the input query, or they may wish to retrieve a list of images which are most similar to another image. It is even possible to retrieve a set of images that best match a given passage.

In Weaviate, such operations to retrieve objects are performed using the `Get` function.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Get` function syntax

A basic `Get` function looks as follows:

import GetSyntax from './_snippets/academy.queries.get.syntax.mdx';

<GetSyntax/>

- The `Class` field specifies the name of the class of objects to be retrieved.
- The `arguments` argument specifies the search criteria to be used to retrieve the objects.
- The `properties` argument specifies the properties of the objects to be retrieved, including any `_additional` properties.

Now let's try out some concrete `Get` queries.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Standalone `Get` queries

A basic, standalone, `Get` query might look as follows:

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

import GetStandalone from './_snippets/academy.queries.get.standalone.mdx';

<GetStandalone/>

What results do you expect? See if you can correspond each field to the syntax.

Now, try it out yourself. This query should return something like the below:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "answer": "Amazon.com",
          "question": "On July 16, 1995 this company made its first sale, a science textbook"
        },
        {
          "answer": "Parfait",
          "question": "The French name of this layered ice cream dessert means \"perfect\""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Response object from Weaviate

As you see above, the response object from Weaviate is in JSON format, where the results are obtained via the `data` field. It is then arranged in a corresponding manner to reflect the query as well as the queried object.

In the above example, the `Get` field reflects the query function, and the `JeopardyQuestion` field reflects the queried object class, containing returned objects. Each object contains `answer` and `question` fields, reflecting the requested properties.

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

In this case, Weaviate will return two objects due to the `.with_limit(2)` argument. Without this limit, Weaviate would return a maximum number according to its configuration.

:::tip Is this query useful?
As this does not apply any user-specific criteria to the search, the specific results will likely not be very useful.

However, this may be a viable method for "sanity" checks, such as checking that you can connect to a Weaviate instance, or that at least some objects have been imported successfully.
:::

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Class` and `properties`

In the above example, we specify a `Class` of `JeopardyQuestion` and `properties` of `questions` and `answer`.

That is possible because those are available as defined in the schema, as shown below:

<details>
  <summary>How to I see the schema?</summary>

You can fetch the schema like this - try it out!

```python
client.schema.get()
```

</details>

import ShortSchema from './_snippets/academy.queries.schema.short.mdx';

<ShortSchema/>

The `Class` and `properties` fields must correspond to collections of objects that have been defined in the Weaviate schema.

The `Class` must be the name of a data object collection, and the `properties` a list of properties to be retrieved.

The schema contains the `JeopardyQuestion` class, with properties: `question`, `answer` and `points`.

So, a query retrieving objects from the `Question` class could specify any of its properties such as `question`, `answer`, and `points`.

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try out the above query again, with these changes.
- Can you get the `points` property as well?
- What happens if you don't specify any properties?
:::

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Get` with `additional` properties

You can retrieve additional properties that are not defined in the schema. These properties may be inherent to the object, or relate to the query performed.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

In this example, we've built on the previous example to add the `.with_additional` method.

import GetWithAdditional from './_snippets/academy.queries.get.with.additional.mdx';

<GetWithAdditional/>

Again, consider what the response might look like. What would have changed in the response?

Now, try it out yourself. This query should return something like the below:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.1791926,
            "id": "b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e"
          },
          "answer": "escaping the Earth's gravity (and go off into outer space, on your way to the moon, for instance)",
          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this"
        },
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.18123823,
            "id": "ef263438-b152-5540-97f7-99f4076bd124"
          },
          "answer": "the Milky Way",
          "question": "This is the name of our own galaxy"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Response object from Weaviate

In this response, you see that the `_additional` field has been added to the response object, with `distance` and `id` nested under it.

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

Here, the `distance` and `id` properties contain the object's distance to the query and its unique ID respectively.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`_additonal` properties

As the name suggests, `_additional` properties are separate to those explicitly created as class properties.

The above query included the `distance` property in the `_additional` field. This represents the degree of similarity (or, in this case, the *dissimilarity*) between the input vector and the vector of the object.

:::info Vectors available through `_additional`

The object vector can also be retrieved through an `_additional` field, by specifying `vector` in its sub-field.

Note that the returned vector in many cases will be a very long list of numbers.

:::

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try out the above query again, with these changes.
- Can you get the `vector` property as well?
- Earlier, providing an empty list as the main properties under the `.get()` method will have caused an error. What happens if you try it again, now that you are requesting additional properties?
