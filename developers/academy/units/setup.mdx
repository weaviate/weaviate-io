## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview

Follow this short guide to make sure that you are set up to use Weaviate with the Python client.

<!-- <img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/> -->

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Python & Python client

If you have not yet set up Python and the Weaviate Python client, follow the below instructions.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Python

You can install Python 3 in a variety of ways. One easy way is to use an appropriate installer for your system as per instructions on [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install the Weaviate client

:::tip Virtual environments
It is best practice to use virtual environments to isolate projects.

If you're not familiar with virtual environments, we highly recommend reading up on them - this tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) is a good resource, as is this article on [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), which goes a little more in-depth.
:::

You will also need the following libraries:

```
weaviate-client
```

Activate your virtual environment, and install the Weaviate client with:

```shell
pip install weaviate-client
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Running your Python code

We recommend running Python code in a Jupyter notebook. You can install the library by running

```shell
pip install notebook
```

Then running the shown code in a Jupyter notebook. Of course, you can also run it in any way that you prefer.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instance access

We will be accessing a pre-built instance of Weaviate throughout the course, located at `https://edu-demo.weaviate.network`.

You can access the instance with the below code, using a read-only Weaviate API key.

Confirm that you can run the below code, to make sure it is all functioning as expected.

import InstantiationCheck from './_snippets/academy.instantiation.check.mdx';

<InstantiationCheck/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inference API Key

We will be using OpenAI's API, so you will need an API key.

If you haven't yet, create an OpenAI account, and create a [free API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Then, instantiate the client as shown below, replacing `<OPENAI-KEY>` with your own API key for OpenAI.

import InstantiationWithOpenai from './_snippets/academy.instantiation.with.openai.mdx';

<InstantiationWithOpenai/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Code examples

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Client instantiation

For brevity, many code examples in the Weaviate Academy will not show the instantiation of the client. So, where you see examples such as:

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["intergalactic travel"]}
).with_limit(2).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

You will need to instantiate the client as shown in the previous section. So, the above code would become:

```python
import weaviate

client = weaviate.Client(
    url="https://edu-demo.weaviate.network",
    auth_client_secret=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(api_key="learn-weaviate"),  # A read-only API Key for the Weaviate instance
    additional_headers={
        "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": "<OPENAI-KEY>",  # Replace this with YOUR OpenAI API key
    }
)

response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["intergalactic travel"]}
).with_limit(2).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;GraphQL

Weaviate Academy units are written to be used with a client library such as Python. So, you will not need to run GraphQL or REST queries directly.

But note that we also show raw GraphQL/REST queries as well as the Python code where relevant to help you learn the underlying query structures.

So please be aware that when we show a query such as this:

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["intergalactic travel"]}
).with_limit(2).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

We are performing, under the hood, the below:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["intergalactic travel"]
        }
      limit: 2
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```

We will show them in separate tabs going forward where applicable, like so:

<!-- Delete these imports if already imported in the file -->
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
This tab will show Python code.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
This tab will show GraphQL code.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Raw GraphQL queries

Note that you can run raw GraphQL queries directly with the Weaviate Python client, or with the [Weaviate Console](https://console.weaviate.io/).

In Python, you can run a GraphQL query directly with:

```python
query = '''
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["intergalactic travel"]
        }
      limit: 2
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
'''

response = client.query.raw(query)
print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

<!-- Or, the Weaviate Console provides a graphical interface that you can connect to your Weaviate instance and run queries. -->

<!-- TODO - show specific steps to do this when WCS launches -->

### <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Key takeaways

- You have installed the Weaviate client library in your preferred environment.
- You have an OpenAI inference key.
- You have some way of running Python code.
- You know how to instantiate the Weaviate Python client, and run the shown example code.
- The Academy units will show Python code, but also raw GraphQL or REST snippets where applicable.
