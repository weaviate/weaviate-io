Hi there! Welcome to the first unit on queries in Weaviate. In this unit, you will learn about the various ways with which you can use Weaviate to find the information you need.

We'll start by exploring the different vector search methods available in Weaviate, including `nearVector`, `nearObject`, and `nearText`. You'll learn how these methods work and how they can be used to find relevant data.

In addition to vector search methods, you'll also learn about filters that can be applied to refine your search results. For example, you may want to search for data objects that are within a certain distance of a given vector, or you may want to exclude data objects that do not match certain criteria.

By the end of this unit, you will have a good understanding of the available search strategies and tactics in Weaviate. This knowledge will help you to build the best search application for your needs and to select the right data structure for your data.

So let's get started.
