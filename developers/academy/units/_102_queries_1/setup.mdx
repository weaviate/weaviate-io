## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Python & Python client

We will be using Python for this unit.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Python

You can install Python 3 in a variety of ways. One easy way is to use an appropriate installer for your system as per instructions on [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a virtual environment

:::tip Virtual environments
It is best practice to use virtual environments to isolate projects.

If you're not familiar with virtual environments, we highly recommend reading up on them - this tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) is a good resource, as is this article on [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), which goes a little more in-depth.
:::

You will also need the following libraries:

```
weaviate-client
weaviate-demo-datasets
jupyterlab
```

Activate your virtual environment, and install these libraries with:

```shell
pip install weaviate-client weaviate-demo-datasets jupyterlab
```

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaviate Instance

Check that you have an instance of Weaviate running for use in this unit.

If you do not have one, we recommend setting one up **without authentication**.

Follow the "Get Started with WCS" [section on this page](../101_hello_weaviate/set_up.mdx#get-started-with-wcs) and come back.

:::tip What is your Weaviate instance address?
Make sure you know what your Weaviate instance address is - it should look like:
```
https://your-instance-name.weaviate.network
```
:::

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inference API Key

We will be using an inference API in this unit, using OpenAI's API by default with `text2vec-openai`.

Create an OpenAI account, and create a [free API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check instance access

Try running this code, replacing `your-instance-name` with the actual name:

```python
import weaviate
import os
import json

wv_url = "https://your-instance-name.weaviate.network"
# Provide your OpenAI key here.
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # This reads the API key as an environment variable.

client = weaviate.Client(
    url=wv_url,
    additional_headers={"X-OpenAI-Api-Key": api_key},
)

print(json.dumps(client.schema.get(), indent=2))
```

If you see the below, you have successfully queried your Weaviate instance.
```json
{
  "classes": []
}
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upload dataset

We have prepared the `weaviate-demo-datasets` library for tutorials and demos. For this unit, run the following code in Python to upload the dataset into your Weaviate instance.

```python
import weaviate_datasets
wiki_dataset = weaviate_datasets.WikiArticles()
wiki_dataset.upload_dataset(client, batch_size=200)
jeopardy_dataset = weaviate_datasets.JeopardyQuestions10k()
jeopardy_dataset.upload_dataset(client, batch_size=200)
```

This will upload a handful of Wikipedia articles, and (10,000) questions from the quiz show *Jeopardy!* to your Weaviate instance. This should take about ~5 minutes, depending on your set-up, so we recommend grabbing a coffee or tea.

The *Jeoaprdy!* dataset **includes vectors**, so you will not incur API costs, and the Wikipedia articles should be small enough for the free account.

:::tip Too slow? Try the smaller dataset.
If you want something faster, you can use the smaller `JeopardyQuestions1k` dataset:
```
jeopardy_dataset = weaviate_datasets.JeopardyQuestions1k()
```
:::

Now, running:

```python
print(json.dumps(client.schema.get(), indent=2))
```

Should return:

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "class": "JeopardyCategory",
      "description": "A Jeopardy! category",
      ... // truncated
      "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai"
    },
    {
      "class": "JeopardyQuestion",
      "description": "A Jeopardy! question",
      ...  // truncated
      "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai"
    },
    {
      "class": "WikiArticle",
      "description": "A Wikipedia article",
      ...  // truncated
      "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai"
    }
  ]
}
```

And you are good to go!
