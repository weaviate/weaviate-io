### `Get` with cross-references

And before we wrap up this section, let's take a look at how to perform a `Get` query with cross-references. While we have not yet covered cross-references in detail in this unit, for now it is sufficient to know that they are a way to connect objects to each other.

In the example below, we will perform a `Get` query on the `Question` class, but this time we will include the `hasCategory` property in the query. This property is a cross-reference to the `Category` class, and will be used to return the category of each question.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 1
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Seafaring technology from Scandanavia."],
      }   
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      hasCategory {
        ... on Category {
          title
          _additional {
            id
          }            
        }
      }      
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This produces a result like the following:

<details>
  <summary>Query results</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.14927602,
            "id": "5d9d5c8d-13e7-5791-b2f9-3724a1a1d301"
          },
          "answer": "Oslo",
          "hasCategory": [
            {
              "_additional": {
                "id": "fec50326-dfa1-53c9-90e8-63d0240bd933"
              },
              "title": "MUSEUMS"
            }
          ],
          "question": "1,200-year-old Viking ships are on display at the Vikingskiphuset in this Norwegian capital"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Where the `hasCategory` property is now an array of objects, containing objects of type `Category` that the Question is related to and their requested properties. The `title` property of the `Category` class is returned as well, and the `_additional` field contains the `id` of the category. 

Cross-references provide you with a great deal of flexibility and power in your data model, and are a great way to connect objects to each other. We will cover them in more detail in our unit on schemas.

:::info `...` pattern
You may have noticed the `... on Category` pattern in the above query. This syntax is called a "fragment" in GraphQL terms. Populated this way, the fragment specifies that the `hasCategory` property is of type `Category`, and that the results should be returned as such.
