<!-- Provide context for this course, in addition to the concrete learning goals and outcomes. Why would someone want to do this unit? -->

Embedding models form a cornerstone of modern retrieval systems. Recent developments and subsequent proliferation of embedding models have greatly improved their capabilities. But this also makes model selection a very challenging task with a vast set of ever-expanding options.

This module will tackle how to navigate this landscape, and teach skills to screen, evaluate and select models.
