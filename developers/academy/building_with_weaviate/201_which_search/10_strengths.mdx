## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview

These different search types are offered because they each have different characteristics, and therefore different strengths.

Let's explore the relative strengths of each search type.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengths of vector search

Key strengths of vector search are its robustness and versatility. Let's explore these in more detail.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Robustness

A vector is a numerical representation of the underlying object's meaning. As a result, a vector search is robust to any changes that don't affect the meaning of the object.

More concretely, a vector of "cat", for example, will be similar to a vector of "kitten", "feline", and "pet", even though their spellings are very different.

Similarly, a vector of "cat" is similar to the vector of "cat" with a spelling mistake, such as "caat", or "catt".

:::danger TODO
SHOW VECTOR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN WORDS
:::

This robustness is a key strength of vector search, as it means that the searcher does not need to know the exact words used in the dataset. This is particularly useful when the concepts being searched for are not well-defined, or when the searcher is not familiar with the dataset.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Versatility

A vector search is also versatile. It can be used to search multiple data modalities (e.g. text, images, audio, etc.), and across multiple languages.

This is because the vector is a numerical representation of the underlying object's meaning, and therefore the same vector can be used to represent the same meaning, regardless of the data modality or language.

In fact, some models are capable of search across multiple data modalities, or multiple languages (or both!). In the example below, we search a dataset of text and images.

:::danger TODO
SHOW VECTOR SEARCH ACROSS MULTIPLE DATA MODALITIES
:::

Note that the query is a text query, but the results include both text and images. This is because the query is converted into a vector, and then the vector is used to search the dataset.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengths of keyword search

Key strengths of keyword search are its speed, and exactitude. Let's explore these in more detail.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed

Keyword searches are generally the fastest out of these search types.

They are fast as they direct match the search keywords with indexed keywords in the database. This direct matching process significantly reduces the time taken to retrieve results, making keyword search fast.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactitude

Keyword search is ideal for situations where locating precise matches are required. This is particularly useful in scenarios where there exist exact terms to search for, such as academic research, searches through domain-specific data or technical troubleshooting.

The ability to return results that precisely match the search terms ensures that users receive the most relevant information for their specific queries.

More concretely, take a look at the example below, where we search for KEYWORD using both vector and keyword search.

:::danger TODO
SHOW KEYWORD SEARCH FOR DOMAIN-SPECIFIC FORM
:::

And when we inspect the results:

:::danger TODO
SHOW KEYWORD SEARCH FOR DOMAIN-SPECIFIC FORM
:::

A search for KEYWORD_HERE using a keyword search returns more relevant results than a vector search.


## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengths of hybrid search

A key strength of hybrid search is its flexibility. Let's explore this in more detail.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility

A hybrid search is flexible because it combines the strengths of both vector and keyword search. Take a look at the hybrid search example below.

:::danger TODO
SHOW HYBRID SEARCH -
:::

We can inspect the results here to see why each result was included.

:::danger TODO
SHOW HYBRID SEARCH -
:::

You can see that some results are included because they score highly in the vector search, and some are included because they score highly in the keyword search.

Because hybrid search combines the results of both vector and keyword search, it will find objects that score well on at least one of the search types. This approach has the effect of complementing shortcomings each search type.
