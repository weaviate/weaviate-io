As collections with named vectors can include multiple vectors, any vector or similarity search must specify a "target" vector.

This applies for `near_text` and `near_vector` searches, as well as multimodal searches such as `near_image` and so on. Let's explore a few examples here.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Text searches

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

Here, we look for entries in "MovieNVDemo" based on their similarity to the phrase `"A joyful holiday film"`. Note, however, that we show multiple versions of the same query, each with a different `target_vector` parameter:

<Tabs groupId="targetVector">
  <TabItem value="title" label="Title">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# NVTitleSearch"
      endMarker="# END NVTitleSearch"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="overview" label="Overview">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# NVOverviewSearch"
      endMarker="# END NVOverviewSearch"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poster" label="Poster">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# NVPosterSearch"
      endMarker="# END NVPosterSearch"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

Each named vector here is based on a different property of the movie data.

The first search compares the meaning of the movie **title** with the query, the second search compares the **entire summary** (overview) with the query, and the third compares the **poster (and the title)** with the query.

Weaviate also allows each named vector to be set with a different vectorizer. You will recall that the `poster_title` vector is created by the CLIP models, while the `title` and `overview` properties are created by the OpenAI model.

As a result, each named vector can be further specialized by using the right model for the right property.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the results

The results of each search are different, as they are based on different properties of the movie data.

#### `title` vs `overview`

Note that the search with 'overview' target vector includes titles like "Home Alone" and "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York", which are not included in the other searches.

This is because the plot of these movies are holiday-themed, even though the titles are not obviously joyful or holiday-related.

#### `poster`

The search with `poster_title` target vector interestingly includes "Misery" - the Stephen King horror movie! This is very likely because the poster of the movie is a snowy scene. And since the CLIP vectorizer is trained to identify elements of images, it identifies this terrifying film as a result of the search.

Given the imagery of the poster only and no other context, you would have to say that the search isn't wrong, even though anyone who's read the book or watched the movie would agree.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Hybrid search

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

This example finds entries in "MovieNVDemo" with the highest hybrid search scores for the term "history", and prints out the title and release year of the top 5 matches.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MetadataHybridSearch"
  endMarker="# END MetadataHybridSearch"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

Hybrid search with named vectors work the same way as with other vector searches with named vectors. You must provide a `target_vector` parameter to specify the named vector for the vector search component of the hybrid search.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Keyword search

As named vectors affect the vector representations of objects, they do not affect keyword searches. You can perform keyword searches on named vector collections using the same syntax as you would for any other collections.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Named vectors in search

The use of named vectors enables flexible search options that can be tailored to your needs.

Each object can have as many named vectors as you would like, with any combinations of properties and vectorizers, or even multiple custom vectors provided by your own models.

This flexibility allows you to create databases with vector representations that are tailored to your specific use case, and to search for similar items based on any combination of properties.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> What about RAG?

RAG, or retrieval augmented generation, queries with named vectors work the same way as with other vector searches with named vectors. You must provide a `target_vector` parameter to specify the named vector for the vector search component of the RAG query.

This, in turn, can improve the quality of the generation. Let's explore a few examples in the [next section](./20_use_cases.mdx).
