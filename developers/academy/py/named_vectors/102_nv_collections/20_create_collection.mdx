To use named vectors, your collection be configured with named vector definitions.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

This example creates a collection for the movie data, including multiple named vector definitions:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# CreateMovieCollection"
  endMarker="# END CreateMovieCollection"
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

The key difference here is the use of `NamedVectors` class to define vectorizer configurations. Let's review the code in further detail:

:::tip Revision
This code builds on the [multimodal](../../starter_multimodal_data/102_mm_collections/20_create_collection.mdx) example. Review that example for further explanations.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Named vector configuration

This definition allows each object to be represented by three vectors, named `title`, `overview` and `poster_title`.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# NamedVectorConfig"
  endMarker="# END NamedVectorConfig"
  language="py"
/>

#### `title`

This vector representation is generated from the `title` property (`source_properties`). The `text2vec-openai` module is used for vectorization.

You could use this to search for movies by similarities to their titles.

#### `overview`

This vector representation is based on the `overview` property. As such, you could use this to search for movies by similarities to their plot or key ideas.

#### `poster_title`

This vector representation is generated from a combination of the `title` and `poster` properties. The `multi2vec-clip` module is used for vectorization.

Note that the majority of the vector weight is given to the `poster` property (90%), and the rest to the `title` property (10%). This means that the vector representation will be more influenced by the poster than the title.

As this uses a multimodal vectorizer, you could use this to search for movies using any image, or text, by their similarity to the title or poster.
