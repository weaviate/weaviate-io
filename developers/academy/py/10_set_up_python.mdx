Follow this short guide to make sure that you are set up to use Weaviate with the Python client.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Install Python

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Is Python installed?

Open a terminal window (e.g. bash, zsh, Windows PowerShell, Windows Terminal), and run:

```shell
python --version
```

If that did not work, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`:

```shell
python3 --version
```

If you have Python installed, you should see a response like `Python 3.11.8`. If you Python 3.8 or higher installed, you can skip the remainder of this section.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Install Python

To install, follow the instructions for your system on [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, check the version again to confirm that you have a recommended version installed.

:::tip Advanced option: `pyenv`
Another good way to install Python is to install `pyenv`. This will allow you to manage multiple versions of Python on your system. You can find instructions on how to install `pyenv` [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Set up a virtual environment

A virtual environment allows you to isolate various Python projects from each other. This is useful because it allows you to install dependencies for each project without affecting the others.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Create a virtual environment

We recommend using `venv` to create a virtual environment. Navigate to your project directory (e.g. `cd PATH/TO/PROJECT`), and run:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Or, if `python3` is your Python command:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This will create a virtual environment in a directory called `.venv` in your project directory.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Activate the virtual environment

Each virtual environment can be 'activated' and 'deactivated'. When activated, the Python commands you run will use the Python version and libraries installed in the virtual environment.

To activate the virtual environment, go to your project directory and run:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or, if you are using Windows:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="command" label="Command Prompt">

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell">

```shell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can check if the virtual environment is activated by running:

```shell
which python
```

Or, if you are using Windows, run `Get-Command python` (PowerShell) or `where python` (Command Prompt).

If the virtual environment is activated, you should see a path that points to the `.venv` directory.

:::tip Virtual environments
Virtual environments are very useful. If you would like to learn more, try this tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) or this article on [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), which goes a little more in-depth.
<br/>

Additionally, there are many other environment management tools available, such as `conda`, `pipenv`, and `poetry`. If you are already using one of these tools, you can use them instead of `venv`.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Install the Weaviate client

Now, you can install the [Weaviate client library](../../weaviate/client-libraries/index.md), which will make it much easier to interact with Weaviate using Python.

[Activate your virtual environment](#activate-the-virtual-environment), then install the Weaviate client with:

```shell
pip install weaviate-client
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Confirm the installation

To confirm that the Weaviate client is installed, run the following Python code:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# CheckClientLibInstall"
  endMarker="# END CheckClientLibInstall"
  language="py"
/>

You should see an output like:

```text
Your Weaviate client library version is: 4.5.4.
```

Congratulations, you are now set up to use Weaviate with Python and the Weaviate Python client library!
