:::info Pre-requisites
This course is self-contained. However, we recommend that you go through one of the 101-level courses, such as that for working with [text](../starter_text_data/index.md), [your own vectors](../starter_custom_vectors/index.md), or [multimodal data](../starter_multimodal_data/index.md).
:::

As you work with more and more data, the sheer volume of it begins to impose further and further constraints on your ability to work with it. This is especially true the closer you get to production environments, where the cost of storage and the time it takes to process data can become significant.

This course will introduce you to data compression in Weaviate, and how it can be used to reduce your resource requirements and in turn improve performance or reduce costs.
