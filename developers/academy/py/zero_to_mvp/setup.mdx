## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Overview

Follow this short guide to make sure that you are set up to use Weaviate with the Python client.

<!-- <img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/> -->

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Python & Python client

If you have not yet set up Python and the Weaviate Python client, follow the instructions below.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Install Python

You can install Python 3 in a variety of ways. One easy way is to use an appropriate installer for your system as per instructions on [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Install the Weaviate client

:::tip Virtual environments
It is best practice to use virtual environments to isolate projects.

If you're not familiar with virtual environments, we highly recommend reading up on them - this tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) is a good resource, as is this article on [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), which goes a little more in-depth.
:::

You will also need the following libraries:

```
weaviate-client
```

Activate your virtual environment, and install the Weaviate client with:

```shell
pip install weaviate-client
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Running your Python code

We recommend running Python code in a Jupyter notebook. You can install the library by running

```shell
pip install notebook
```

Then running the shown code in a Jupyter notebook. Of course, you can also run it in any way that you prefer.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Instance access

We will be accessing a pre-built instance of Weaviate throughout the course, located at `https://edu-demo.weaviate.network`.

You can connect to the pre-built instance with a read-only Weaviate API key.

Confirm that you can run the following code in your Python environment.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Basic instantiation ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Basic instantiation ====="
  language="py"
/>

If everything works, the code returns `True`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Inference API Key

We will be using OpenAI's API, so you will need an API key.

If you haven't yet, create an OpenAI account, and create a [free API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Then, instantiate the client as shown below, replacing `YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY` with your own API key for OpenAI.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Instantiate to edu-demo with OpenAI ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Instantiate to edu-demo with OpenAI ====="
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Code examples

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Client instantiation

For brevity, many code examples in the Weaviate Academy will not show the instantiation of the client. So, where you see examples such as:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Arbitrary code example ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Arbitrary code example ====="
  language="py"
/>

You will need to instantiate the client as shown in the previous section. So, the above code would become:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Fuller arbitrary code example ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Fuller arbitrary code example ====="
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> GraphQL

Weaviate Academy units are written to be used with a client library such as Python. So, you will not need to run GraphQL or REST queries directly.

But note that we also show raw GraphQL/REST queries as well as the Python code where relevant to help you learn the underlying query structures.

So please be aware that when we show a query such as this:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Arbitrary code example ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Arbitrary code example ====="
  language="py"
/>

This is what happens under the hood:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== Equivalent GraphQL example ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END Equivalent GraphQL example ====="
  language="graphql"
/>

We will show them in separate tabs going forward where applicable, like so:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
This tab will show Python code.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
This tab will show GraphQL code.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Raw GraphQL queries

Note that you can run raw GraphQL queries directly with the Weaviate Python client, or with the [Weaviate Console](https://console.weaviate.io/).

In Python, you can run a GraphQL query directly with:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# ===== GraphQL example with Python execution ====="
  endMarker="# ===== END GraphQL example with Python execution ====="
  language="py"
/>

<!-- Or, the Weaviate Console provides a graphical interface that you can connect to your Weaviate instance and run queries. -->

<!-- TODO - show specific steps to do this when WCS launches -->

### <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i> Key takeaways

- You have installed the Weaviate client library in your preferred environment.
- You have an OpenAI inference key.
- You have some way of running Python code.
- You know how to instantiate the Weaviate Python client, and run the shown example code.
- The Academy units will show Python code, but also raw GraphQL or REST snippets where applicable.
