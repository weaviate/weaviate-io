## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i> Unit review

In this unit, you saw how data is structured in Weaviate, and got hands-on experience populating your own instance of Weaviate from start to finish.

You have got hands-on experience in defining and creating a schema including classes, properties, data types and vectorization configurations. You also had a chance to import data according to this schema, and learned how to use batch imports to ensure that imports are as fast as possible.

Now, you should have a broad understanding of Weaviate's indexes and schema, and how they work to store data to enable efficient, flexible, and powerful retrieval.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-list-check"></i> Learning outcomes

Having finished this unit, you should be able to:
- Describe how the schema and indexes relate to how data is stored in Weaviate.
- Understand how classes and properties represent your data, and how to define them.
- Populate Weaviate with data, using batch imports.
