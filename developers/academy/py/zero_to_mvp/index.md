:::info
This course was written for the Weaviate Python client library (`v3`). We are in the process of updating the content to the latest version of the client.
<br/>

If you are new to Weaviate, we recommend you start with one of the 101-level courses, such as those for working with [text data](../starter_text_data/index.md), [your own vectors](../starter_custom_vectors/index.md), or [multimodal data](../starter_multimodal_data/index.md).
:::

This course is designed to get you started with Weaviate, so that you can go from being new to Weaviate to building an MVP-level product with Weaviate in a short period of time.

Along the way, you'll develop intuitions about not only how Weaviate works, but also how vectors work, and how vector searches work. You'll also learn how to use Weaviate's client library so that you can get going in a language that you are familiar with.

By the time you're done with these short units, you'll be able to build your own instance of Weaviate with your own data, and have a suite of search tools at your disposal so that you can get the data you want in the format you want it.
