So far, we've explained the phrase "vector search" based on what it does - which is a similarity-based search. We've also used it somewhat interchangeably with "semantic search" in this context. Now, let's pause to dig into the details a little more.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Vectors and vector search

The name "vector search" comes from the fact that we use "vectors" to perform these similarity-based searches. In other words, it is an implementation of a similarity-based search.

So what, exactly, is a vector?

A vector in this context is a set of numbers. To be precise, a vector is **an one-dimensional array of numbers**, such as `1, 5, 5`, `0.591, -0.132, 0, 0.105`, or `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`.

:::note Vector representation
A vector is typically shown as its constituent numbers wrapped in square brackets. So, the above vectors may be typically represented as `[1, 5, 5]`, `[0.591, -0.132, 0, 0.105]` and `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` respectively.

A vector itself is a relatively small concept. It's a collection, or a one-dimensional array, of numbers. This may not seem like much in itself. But the real power of vectors comes from the fact that they can be used to represent meaning. So how can a series of numbers represent meaning?

This is **the** big idea, and one that perhaps takes the most getting used to, if you are new to the concept. Come with us on this journey, and we'll do our best to explain.

:::info Vector / tensor / array
If you have seen words like "tensor", or "array", in a similar context they generally refer to the same thing - with perhaps slight differences depending on whether they might be referring to particular software libraries, or the number of dimensions.

The real power of vectors comes from the fact that they can be used to represent meaning. This insight and development, along with modern developments in deep learning, is what powers vector searches.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Everyday examples of vectors

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ikf0N.jpg)

One way to think about it is that each number in a vector represents a particular aspect of meaning. Then, the vector itself represents the combination of all of these aspects.

In fact, many of you may have already used vectors to describe aspects of meaning. For example, you may have used a vector to:
- Describe the position of an object in space by sending a location pin to somebody. This is a vector that contains numbers for the latitude and longitude, or
- Describe the color of an object by a vector of numbers that represent the red, green and blue (and perhaps transparency) components of the color.

In each of these examples, each number in the vector represents a particular aspect of the object, such as its longitude or how green the object is. The entire vector combines these aspects to represent the "meaning", such as its location or its color.

Extending this idea, the above two vectors might be combined to one vector that contains its latitude, longitude, red, green, blue and transparency. This vector would then represent the object's location and color.

In other words, a vector can represent any property of an object by enumerating a property such as how far north it is, how far west it is, how red it is, how green it is, how blue it is, and how transparent it is.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Why use vectors to represent meaning?

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*SYiW1MUZul1NvL1kc1RxwQ.png)

The semantic use of vectors extends this idea further to represent meaning of words, sentences, or even entire documents.

Again, each number in a vector represents a particular aspect of meaning. Imagine how you would try to represent words like "lion", "grapefruit", "cat" and "cow". You might have each numbers within a vector capture different aspects, such as:
- How "furry" the object is
- How "big" the object is
- How "dangerous" the object is
- How "edible" the object is

And so on.

Then, the vector itself would represent the combination of all of these aspects. So, a vector for the word "lion" might be `[0.8, 0.9, 0.9, 0.1]`, while a vector for the word "grapefruit" might be `[0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9]`.

Each number in a vector represents a particular aspect of meaning, and the entire vector represents the combination of all of these aspects.

A "real" vector that is generated by modern language models are simply longer. A vector that is used to represent the word "lion" might have a much longer length, such as hundreds or thousands of numbers, but the idea is the same. Each number represents some aspect of a meaning, and the resulting entire vector can be used to represent the meaning of the word.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> How are vectors actually generated?

![](../../tmp_images/a_machine_with_a_conveyer_belt_producing_many_long_numbers_0.jpg)

Vectors are generated by machine learning models. These models are trained on large amounts of data, and are able to learn the relationships between words and their meanings.

These models use the training data to infer relationships between words and their meanings. For example, a model might learn that the word "lion" is similar to the word "tiger" because they are both big cats. It might also learn that the word "lion" is similar to the word "cow" because they are both animals. And then, they use this knowledge to find-tune individual numbers in vectors such that they best represent the meaning of the words.

This is why choosing the right model is so important. The model you choose will have a significant impact on the quality of the vectors, and what it means to be "similar" to another word.

A model that is trained based on how words are used in everyday English is going to be different from a model that is trained on how words are used in scientific papers, or in particular domains such as medicine or law.

We will cover this in more detail elsewhere in the course, in regards to how to choose the right model for your use case.
