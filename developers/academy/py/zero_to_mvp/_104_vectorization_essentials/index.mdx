<!-- Provide context for this course, in addition to the concrete learning goals and outcomes. Why would someone want to do this unit? -->

Welcome! This unit builds on the previous introductory unit on queries to provide more context and background on the theory, including a look under the hood.

We will begin by talking about why vector searches work, and what helps them to work so well. This discussion will touch on deep learning models that power vector searches, including why they are so important. This unit will also show you how Weaviate turns data into vectors, as well as how any why you could customize this behavior. We will also discuss groups of vectorizers that are available with Weaviate and rules of thumb on vectorizer selection, so that you can make good, informed decisions to get started with.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-list-check"></i> Prerequisites

- (**Required**) A running instance of Weaviate
  - We recommended a `sandbox` instance on [WCS](https://console.weaviate.io)
  - With sample dataset "JeopardyQuestions" imported (from [`weaviate-demo-datasets`](https://pypi.org/project/weaviate-demo-datasets/))
- (*Recommended*) Complete [Hello, Weaviate](../101_hello_weaviate/index.mdx)
- (*Recommended*) Complete [Queries 1](../102_queries_1/index.mdx)
