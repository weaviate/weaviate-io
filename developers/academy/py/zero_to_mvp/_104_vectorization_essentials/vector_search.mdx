### How does vector search work?

![](../../tmp_images/person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_in_front_of_a_big_pile_of_numbers_1.jpg)

Earlier on, we mentioned that a vector can be used to represent the meaning of a word. In an earlier section, we also mentioned that a vector search is a fantastic way of carrying out similarity-based searches.

You can probably see how these two ideas converge. A vector search relies on these numerical representation of meaning to carry out similarity-based searches. The closer two vectors are to each other, the more similar the words they represent.

A vector search therefore works by providing a vector-based query object to a vector index. The vector index then returns a list of results that are most similar to the query object.

It may be that a vector index takes as input an object such as a text passage or an image which it converts to a vector. Or it may receive a vector as the query object directly.

### How is vector similarity measured?

![](../../tmp_images/scale_of_justice_with_words_on_either_side_0.jpg)

Broadly speaking, vector similarity measures how close the two sets of numbers that make up each vector are to each other. Depending on your relationship with linear algebra, this may sound like a very abstract concept.

But the intuition is this: the closer the two vectors are to each other, the more similar the words they represent.

In practice, there are many different ways to measure vector similarity. The most common methods include:
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product
- Manhattan distance

The choice of similarity measure will depend on the use case and the model. In Weaviate, the default metric unless specified is `cosine similarity`. We will cover these choices in more detail in another section.

### What is a semantic search?

![](../../tmp_images/confused_people_looking_at_two_similar_piles_of_documents__1.jpg)

"Semantic" refers to something being "related to meaning". It is often used in the field of linguistics (study of languages) to contrast to "syntactic", which refers to structure or grammar. Thus "semantic search" refers to a search that is based on meaning.

Vector search is currently the dominant way of performing semantic searches. Because vectors can efficiently and accurate capture meanings of words, sentences and entire documents, they are a great way of carrying out semantic searches.

We note that "semantic" search also can refer to searches that look for similarities in concepts that are represented by other media such as images, audio or video. As you will see later on, semantic searches refer to comparing particular aspects of these media types, such as the depicted concepts, objects, or tone.

Accordingly, we will use the terms "semantic search" and "vector search" interchangeably in this course unless otherwise specified.

### What is a lexical search?

![](../../tmp_images/person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_in_front_of_a_big_pile_of_words_1.jpg)

Traditional search systems use "lexical" searches, based on a "vocabulary" of the search system or database at hand.

A lexical search relies on matching exact strings or substrings and using various operators to manipulate sets of information that either meets or does not meet certain criteria.

For example, looking through a database of recipes to retrieve all objects containing the ingredient "chili" is a lexical search. You might typically combine multiple conditions. The following query looks for entries with "chili" that where added after the year 2010.

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipe_table WHERE (ingredients LIKE '%chili%') AND (entry_year > 2010)
```

While this enquiry will return an exact answer, it suffers from being  inflexible.

For one, it would not retrieve recipes where another string is used (e.g. `ghost pepper`) that is synonymous (has the same meaning) with chili. It would also not handle typos well, for example if the entry was mislabelled as `chilli`, or if the entry was mistyped as such.

On the other hand, semantic searches manage these issues with a little more nuance.

:::note Jargon ("lexical", "semantic", "syntactic")
We try to avoid jargon unless necessary. But where we do use them, we will include explanations for those who have not encountered them.

Because vector search as we use them has some roots in *natural language processing*, terms like *lexical* and *semantic* are commonly used. These are terms that come from linguistics which are used commonly in vector search context. The term *vector* comes from the world of mathematics, as you will see later on. ðŸ¤“

### Vector search vs lexical searches

![](../../tmp_images/person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_in_front_of_a_big_pile_of_numbers_1.jpg)
![](../../tmp_images/person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_in_front_of_a_big_pile_of_words_1.jpg)

When facing a query of a recipes database with the word `chili` for ingredients, a vector database returns entities that include that exact word in the recipe data.

This means that a search for `chili` would include in its results entities with semantically related terms such as `ghost pepper`, `jalapeno`, `habanero` or `carolina reaper`, all of which would be ignored by a lexical search.

A modern vector search can also take the context into account, such as the context of a word as a part of its parent sentence. So a vector search will differentiate between whether the recipe calls for these ingredients, or whether the recipe asks the cook to "*not* use any chili".

Also importantly, a vector database can determine the degree of similarity between items, such as between a query and each result. Accordingly, the results can be ranked by a meaningful metric that describes the degree of similarity, thereby improving the chance of finding more relevant results faster.
