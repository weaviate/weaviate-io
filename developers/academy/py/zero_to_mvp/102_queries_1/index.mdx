In this unit, you will learn how to efficiently retrieve relevant objects or aggregated information from Weaviate.

You have already encountered some examples of vector searches. In this section, we will delve deeper by reviewing the various vector search methods available in Weaviate, such as `nearVector`, `nearObject`, and `nearText`.

Along with vector search methods, you will also discover filters that can be employed to accompany search operators. For instance, you will learn how to search for data objects that exclude specific criteria.

As we examine these capabilities, we will simultaneously use them as a means to gain insight into the inner workings of Weaviate.

Upon completing this unit, you will possess a thorough understanding of how to effectively query Weaviate to obtain desired results, as well as the underlying mechanisms that make it all possible.
