## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i> Unit review

In this unit, you have acquired valuable knowledge on querying Weaviate to retrieve the right objects or aggregate information effectively. We dived deep into various search operators available in Weaviate, such as `nearVector`, `nearObject`, and `nearText`, and filters that can be applied to refine your search results by focusing on specific criteria, enabling you to extract more accurate and relevant information.

You have also learned some of the key principles around how Weaviate applies these operators to perform searches. You have learned how certain search operators are used, and how filtering works.

Now that you are armed with knowledge about how to query Weaviate, in the next module we will learn how to build a Weaviate instance, from schema creation to data import.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-list-check"></i> Learning outcomes

Now, you should be able to:
- Construct 'Get' queries to retrieve relevant objects and desired properties.
- Construct 'Aggregate' queries to retrieve aggregated properties about relevant objects.
- Differentiate and apply appropriate search operators with filters such as `nearVector`, `nearObject` and `nearText` with distance and limit thresholds.
- Add filters to queries.
- Describe how Weaviate applies search operators and filters to perform searches.
