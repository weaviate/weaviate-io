## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Available operators

So far, you've seen different query functions such as `Get`, and `Aggregate`, and search operators such as `nearVector`, `nearObject` and `nearText`.

Now, let's take a look at filters.

A filter is a way to specify additional criteria to be applied to the results. There are a number of available filters in Weaviate.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Available filters

There exist many available filters, but we do not need to cover them all at this moment. For now, let's explore a few of the most commonly used filters:

- `where`: Apply a Boolean condition to filter the available data.
- `limit`: Restrict the maximum objects to be retrieved.
- `offset`: For pagination of search results.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Filter data with `where`

The `where` filter is analogous to the `WHERE` clause in a SQL query. As in the SQL clause, the `where` filter can be used to apply a boolean conditional to the data.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Single operand example

We ran an example query like this earlier:

import GetWithAdditional from './_snippets/academy.queries.get.with.additional.mdx';

<GetWithAdditional/>

Which returned these answers:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.1791926,
            "id": "b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e"
          },
          "answer": "escaping the Earth's gravity (and go off into outer space, on your way to the moon, for instance)",
          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this"
        },
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.18123823,
            "id": "ef263438-b152-5540-97f7-99f4076bd124"
          },
          "answer": "the Milky Way",
          "question": "This is the name of our own galaxy"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

So let's extend our query to now include a `where` argument that uses a `Like` operator.

import FilterWhereLike from './_snippets/academy.queries.filter.where.like.mdx';

<FilterWhereLike/>

Can you guess how you would expect the earlier response to change, if at all?

Here is the actual response:

          "question": "He's been called the \"Father of Modern Rocketry\""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Observe that the results have changed. The previous results have been removed as they do not contain the text `rocket` in the `question` property.

This approach of combining a vector search with a filter is a powerful way to find objects that are similar to a given input, but also meet additional criteria as you see. And while filtering may remove some objects which might otherwise be "closer" to the query vector than the remaining ones, it provides a powerful strategy to find the most relevant objects by removing false positive.

</details>

We can apply the query to filter the data in any number of ways. For example, consider this query:

import FilterWhereGreater from './_snippets/academy.queries.filter.where.greater.mdx';

<FilterWhereGreater/>

How do you expect that this query will be different to the earlier queries?

This query has been modified to only return `JeopardyQuestion` objects with a `points` value greater than 200.

Accordingly, the returned data set is very different.

</details>

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try filtering for `JeopardyQuestion` objects with:
- a `points` value equal to 200
- a `points` value greater than or equal to 600

You can find the list of available operators on [this page](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/filters#filter-structure).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Multiple operands example

The query syntax can extend to beyond a single operand to take advantage of multiple conditions:

import FilterMultipleOperands from './_snippets/academy.queries.filter.multiple.operands.mdx';

<FilterMultipleOperands/>

Take a look at the `where` argument (i.e. `.with_where`). What limitations do you expect in the results?

          "question": "A campus for the University of Alabama is here, nicknamed \"Rocket City, U.S.A.\""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

This query has been modified to only return `JeopardyQuestion` objects with a `points` value great than than 400, AND include the text `rocket` in the `question` field.

</details>

You can apply these filters to an `Aggregate` query also. Try it yourself.

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try these:
- adding a `where` filter to an `Aggregation` query, following the above pattern.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Result pagination with `offset`

When you query for data, you can use the `offset` operator to skip a number of results. This is useful for pagination, where you want to show a certain number of results per page.

The `offset` operator works in conjunction with the existing `limit` operator to shows results from the `offset+1` to `offset+1+limit`.

For example, to list the first ten results, set `limit`: 10. Then, to "display the second page of 10", set `offset`: 10, `limit`:10 and so on.

The syntax, using `offset` is as follows:

import FilterPaginationNeartext from './_snippets/academy.queries.filter.pagination.nearText.mdx';

<FilterPaginationNeartext/>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "answer": "the Milky Way",
          "question": "Into the 20th Century it was thought the universe was one big galaxy--this one"
        },
        {
          "answer": "space shuttles",
          "question": "These transports, first sent up in 1981, lift off like a rocket & land like a plane"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

This query retrieves the next 2 results (`limit`: 2) after the first 2 results (`offset`: 2).

We can confirm this by comparing the results of two queries with different result limits. The query below retrieves the top 4 results. The last two results from that query are the same as the result in the query that uses limit with pagination.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(limit: 4) {
      answer
      question
    }
  }
}
```

import FilterPaginationRelated from './_snippets/academy.queries.filter.pagination.related.mdx';

<FilterPaginationRelated/>

</details>

:::tip
So, the `n` th page would have `offset`: `n*m`, `limit`: `m`, where `m` is the number of results per page.
:::

The `offset` operator is available with all vector search functions including `Get` and `Aggregate`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i> Key takeaways

- Filters are used to apply additional criteria to the results. Some commonly used filters include `where`, `limit` and `offset`.
- The `where` filter allows you to apply a boolean condition to the data being queried. It can be used with various operators like `Like`, `Greater`, `Equal`, etc.
- You can use multiple conditions within a `where` filter to further refine your query results.
- The `offset` operator can be used in conjunction with `limit` to skip results and build pagination.
