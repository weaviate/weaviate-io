This course was written for the Weaviate Python client API (`v3`), and is now deprecated.

If you are new to Weaviate, we recommend you start with one of the 100-level courses written with the `v4` client API, such as those for working with [text data](/developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/index.md), [your own vectors](/developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/index.md), or [multimodal data](/developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data/index.md).
