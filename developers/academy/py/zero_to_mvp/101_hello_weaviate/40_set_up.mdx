## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Options for running Weaviate

Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS) is a managed service that runs Weaviate for you. You can also manage your own Weaviate instances using Docker, Kubernetes, or Embedded Weaviate.

No matter how you run Weaviate, the underlying code is identical. However, there are some operational differences to be aware of.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> WCS (Recommended)

[WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.cloud/), is a managed SaaS service that requires no maintenance at your end.

As it is managed by Weaviate (the company - the software is not sentient... *yet*). WCS is the fastest way to create a new instance of Weaviate and requires the least amount of effort for users.

WCS has Weaviate instances that are pre-configured for your convenience. They include a number of Weaviate modules by default. They also have built-in support for user authentication.

WCS includes a free "sandbox" tier. The WCS sandbox is our recommended method of running Weaviate in this course.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Docker and Kubernetes

You can run Weaviate instances using containerization solutions such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

Running your own instance provides you with the same Weaviate code base as a WCS instance, but you have to manage configuration and deployment yourself.

This course doesn't cover self-managed instances. We will cover Docker and Kubernetes in separate course units in the future.

If you are familiar with either solution and want to use them to install Weaviate now, see the documentation for [Docker-Compose](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Embedded Weaviate

We also have an experimental feature called [Embedded Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded.md), where you can directly instantiate a Weaviate database from a client library.

Currently, Embedded Weaviate is only recommended for evaluation purposes.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>  Get started with WCS

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>  Sign in to WCS

1. To access WCS, go to the [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud)

1. If you don't have a WCS account, click on the "Register" button to create a new account.

1. Click on "Sign in with the Weaviate Cloud Services" and sign in with your WCS username and password.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>  Create a Weaviate Cluster

To create a new Weaviate Cluster, click the "Create cluster" button.

On the Create a Cluster page:

1. Select the **Free sandbox** plan tier.
1. Provide a *cluster name*. The sandbox URL is based on the cluster-name. WCS adds a suffix to ensure uniqueness.
1. Set the `Enable Authentication?` option to `YES`.
1. Press **Create** to create your sandbox instance. Note that the sandbox will expire after a set number of days.

This starts the process to create a new instance. WCS displays a progress indicator while the sandbox builds.

<img src={WCScreationProgress} width="100%" alt="Creation in progress"/>

Instance creation takes a minute or two. WCS displays a checkmark (‚úîÔ∏è) next to your sandbox when the instance is ready.

There are several ways to work with your sandbox.

- [Client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md)
- [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/index.md)
- [GraphQL API](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/index.md)

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Install Weaviate client

:::info Academy material in Python
For the initial release of Weaviate Academy units, our materials are written around Python examples.<br/><br/>
We are working to add examples for other client languages, starting with TypeScript. We appreciate your patience as we build up our educational material.
