## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Overview

A BM25 search is one implementation of what is commonly called a 'keyword' search. Broadly speaking, it works by matching the search terms between the query and the data objects in the index.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> About `bm25` queries

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> How it works

When a user submits a BM25 query, Weaviate will look for objects that contain the search terms in the text properties of the objects. Then, it will rank the results based on how many times the search terms appear in the text properties of the objects.

In this way, a BM25 query is different to keyword-based filtering, which simply includes or excludes objects based on the provided set of conditions.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> `bm25` query syntax

A BM25 query is shown below. Each BM25 query:

- **Must** include a query string, which can be any length,
- **Can optionally** include a list of `properties` to search,
- **Can optionally** include weights for each searched property, and
- **Can optionally** request a `score` for each result.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# GenericBM25Query"
  endMarker="# END GenericBM25Query"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above query will return the top 3 objects based on its BM25F score, based on the query string `"food"`. The query will search the `question` and `answer` properties of the objects, from which `question` property will be boosted by a factor of 3.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Tokenization and `bm25` searches

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Why tokenization matters

In an earlier unit, we briefly discussed [the inverted index](../103_schema_and_imports/10_data_structure.mdx#inverted-index), and that it stores a "tokenized" index of data.

When a BM25 query is submitted, Weaviate will search each property according to its tokenization property. For example, if a property is tokenized with the `word` tokenization option, it will tokenize the query string into its constituent, lowercase, words, and search for each word in the index. On the other hand, if a property uses a `field` tokenization, Weaviate will look for the entire query string in the index.

:::tip This applies to the inverted index only
This is different to any tokenization in the context of, for example, language models or vectorization models. Tokenization in the context of the current section only applies to the inverted index.
:::

More concretely, let's take a look at some examples.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> `word` tokenization

In this example, we search through the `question` property with the query string `Jeopardy`. The `question` property is tokenized with the `word` tokenization option.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# BM25WithWordTokenization"
  endMarker="# END BM25WithWordTokenization"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `word` tokenization keeps alpha-numeric characters in lowercase, and splits them by whitespace. Accordingly, the search results include those where the `question` property contains the string `Jeopardy!`, which is the title of the TV show.

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# Expected BM25WithWordTokenization results"
  endMarker="# END Expected BM25WithWordTokenization results"
  language="py"
/>

</details>

Now, let's take a look at the same query, but with the `field` tokenization option.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> `field` tokenization

In this example, the query string remains the same (`Jeopardy`), however we are now searching the `round` property, which is tokenized with the `field` tokenization option.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# BM25WithFieldTokenization"
  endMarker="# END BM25WithFieldTokenization"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `field` tokenization trims whitespace characters and then keeps the entire string as is. Accordingly, the search does not return any results, even though we know that `round` values include those such as `Jeopardy!` and `Double Jeopardy!`.

<details>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCodeExample}
  startMarker="# Expected BM25WithFieldTokenization results"
  endMarker="# END Expected BM25WithFieldTokenization results"
  language="py"
/>

</details>

:::tip Exercise
Try changing the query to `Jeopardy!`. What happens to the results?
:::

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Rules of thumb

The [full list of tokenization options](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema/index.md#property-tokenization) are `word`, `whitespace`, `lowercase` and `field`. A rule of thumb on when to use each option is to use `word` for long text where you want to retrieve partial matches, and `field` for short text where you only want to retrieve exact matches. The others are somewhere in between, and may be useful in specific situations, where for example you want case to matter (`whitespace`) or special characters to be respected (`lowercase`).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> BM25F scoring

The exact algorithm used for scoring and ranking the results is called the BM25F algorithm. The details are beyond the scope of this course, but the gist is that the BM25F algorithm is a variant of the BM25 algorithm, where the `F` stands for "field". It is used to score and rank results based on the fields that are searched.

If you would like to delve into the details of the exact algorithm, you can review [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25#Modifications).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i> Key takeaways

- BM25 search matches search terms between the query and data objects in the index and ranks results based on the frequency of those terms.
- A BM25 query must include a query string, and can optionally include a list of properties to search, weights for each searched property, and a request for a score for each result.
- BM25 queries are impacted by the tokenization of the properties being searched; for instance, `word` tokenization splits the query string into lowercase words and `field` tokenization searches for the entire query string.
- Consider your search use case for picking tokenization options. For example, use `word` for long text with partial matches, and `field` for short text with exact matches.
- BM25F scoring, where 'F' stands for 'field', is used to score and rank the search results based on the fields that are searched.
