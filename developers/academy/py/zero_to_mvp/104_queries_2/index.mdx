<!-- Provide context for this course, in addition to the concrete learning goals and outcomes. Why would someone want to do this unit? -->

In this unit, you will learn about even more types of queries that you can run with Weaviate.

We will start by looking how to use keyword searches with the BM25F ranking algorithm, as well as hybrid searches that combines keyword searches with vector searches.

Then, we will look at generative searches and question and answer (QnA) searches. These searches allow you to not only retrieve data objects, but to transform the results before returning them to you.

By the end of this unit, you will have a suite of query types to choose from, so that you can retrieve the right information in the form that you want.

Let's get started.
