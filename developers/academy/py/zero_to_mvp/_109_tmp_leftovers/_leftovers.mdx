## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Running Weaviate queries

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

In this unit, we will focus on various strategies to query Weaviate to retrieve information.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> With the Python client

Although Weaviate uses GraphQL under the hood for queries, you will not need to directly enter GraphQL in this unit. Instead, we will be using the Python client to perform and learn about queries.

But note that we also show raw GraphQL queries as well as the Python code in this unit to help learn the underlying query structures.

So please be aware that when we show a query such as this:

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["intergalactic travel"]}
).with_limit(2).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

This is what happens under the hood:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["intergalactic travel"]
        }
      limit: 2
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```

We will show them in separate tabs going forward where applicable, like so:

<!-- Delete these imports if already imported in the file -->
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
This tab will show Python code.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
This tab will show GraphQL code.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Raw GraphQL queries

Note that you can run raw GraphQL queries directly with the Weaviate Python client, or with the [Weaviate Console](https://console.weaviate.io/).

In Python, you can run a GraphQL query directly with:

```python
query = '''
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["intergalactic travel"]
        }
      limit: 2
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
'''

response = client.query.raw(query)
print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

Or, the Weaviate Console provides a graphical interface that you can connect to your Weaviate instance and run queries.

<!-- TODO - show specific steps to do this when WCS launches -->

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> GraphQL syntax

You will see terms such as `Function`, `Class`, `properties` and `Argument` in this units. They come from Weaviate's GraphQL syntax, which takes this form:

```graphql
{
  <Function> {
    <Class> (<Arguments>) {
      <properties>
    }
  }
}
```

Where:
- `<Function>` is the action,
- `<Class>` is the target data collection,
- `<Arguments>` specifies any options, and
- `<properties>` describes the data to be retrieved.

So keep these terms in mind.

<Quiz questions={queryMethods} />

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Query functions

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

The primary query functions in Weaviate are `Get`, `Aggregate` or `Explore`.

These three functions are used to `Get` objects, `Aggregate` information and `Explore` vector spaces.

Let's review each one briefly, before we learn about them in detail in the following sections.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> `Get` objects

The `Get` function is used in Weaviate to retrieve data objects. For many use cases, `Get` will be the most common type of query function used in Weaviate.

Take a look at the following:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_limit(1).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (limit: 1) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is a `Get` query to `JeopardyQuestion` class, with a limit of maximum `1` returned object, with the object's `["question", "answer"]` properties.

It should produce a response like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "answer": "Amazon.com",
          "question": "On July 16, 1995 this company made its first sale, a science textbook"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can see that the response includes a data object from the `JeopardyQuestion` class, and values of its `question` and `answer` properties.


=================

Notice the presence of the `groupBy` argument.

`groupBy` is an optional argument that can be used to group results of the query. The `Aggregate` function can also return metadata about the results, such as the number of results in each group.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    <CLASS>,
).with_group_by_filter(
    <property>
).with_fields(
    "groupedBy {path value}"  # requires `groupBy` argument
    <properties>
).with_meta_count(  # optional
).<arguments>.do()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate (groupBy:[<property>]) {  # `groupBy`: optional argument
    groupedBy {  # requires `groupBy` argument
        path
        value
    }
    meta {  # optional
      count
    }
    <Class> (
      <arguments>
    ) {
      <properties>
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> `Aggregate` information

Whereas `Get` returns objects, `Aggregate` returns summary statistics or aggregates from the result set.

As such you can use `Aggregate` to obtain summary values such as counts, sums, means and so on from groups of objects. Take a look at the following:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["Animals in movies"]}
).with_object_limit(
    10
).with_meta_count().with_fields("value {maximum minimum mean}").do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      objectLimit: 10
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Animals in movies"]
      }
    ) {
      meta {
        count
      }
      points {
        maximum
        minimum
        mean
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The previous query will grab 10 closest objects to the query text in `JeopardyQuestion` class, and return the maximum, minimum and mean `value` as well as the count.

It should produce a response like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "meta": {
            "count": 10
          },
          "points": {
            "maximum": 1000,
            "mean": 320,
            "minimum": 0
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that even though the query related to a maximum of 10 objects, the result was *one* set of aggregated values.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> `Explore` vector spaces

`Explore` allows you to navigate the entire vector space of objects stored in Weaviate.

This means that you can use `Explore` to find objects that are similar to a given object or vector, regardless of the class of the object. As such, `Explore` is very useful when you may not be sure of what class to search for.

In relation to our dataset, a query using the `Explore` function would return a set of objects from both the `JeopardyQuestion` and `Category` classes.

We will explore the `Explore` function in more detail in a separate, following unit.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Sub-properties for `Aggregate`

As we have seen, the `meta` property is available for all data types, and can be used with the `count` sub-property to return the number of retrieved objects.

In addition to this, there are a number of other sub-properties that can be used with `Aggregate` queries. Their availability, however, depend on the data type that is being queried.

Let's take a look at some of these sub-properties, based on the `Question` class.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Example

Try the following query:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
response = client.query.aggregate(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
).with_fields(
    "round {type topOccurrences {value occurs}}"
).with_near_text(
    {"concepts": ["Intergalactic travel"]}
).with_object_limit(10).with_meta_count().do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Intergalactic travel"],
        distance: 0.2
      }
      ) {
      meta {
        count
      }
      round {
        type
        topOccurrences {
          value
          occurs
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Take a note of the requested properties in the GraphQL query, and consider what types of values they might return. How might these properties change according to the nature of the source data?

Now, try it out yourself. The query should return something like this:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "meta": {
            "count": 10
          },
          "round": {
            "topOccurrences": [
              {
                "occurs": 5,
                "value": "Double Jeopardy!"
              },
              {
                "occurs": 4,
                "value": "Jeopardy!"
              },
              {
                "occurs": 1,
                "value": "Final Jeopardy!"
              }
            ],
            "type": "text"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

The sub-properties under `round` in the query requests additional aggregations here, resulting in the top occurring answers being returned as well as their counts.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Available sub-properties

Sub-properties allow further granular aggregations of data from Weaviate. These properties that can be queried will vary according to the data type that is being aggregated.

Along with the `string` data type, `text` properties may be queried to retrieve one or more of:

- count
- type
- topOccurrences

However, `int` data types, for example, can be aggregated to retrieve:

- count
- type
- minimum
- maximum
- mean
- median
- mode
- sum

:::note <i class="fa-solid fa-square-terminal"></i> Exercise
Try out the above query again, with these changes.
- Can you aggregate the results based on the data from the `answer` property?
- Try modifying the query to group the results by `round`, and then aggregate top occurrences from `answer`.
