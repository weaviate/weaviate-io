Congratulations! You have completed this course on vector indexes. We hope you found it helpful and informative.

## Index selection

When choosing an index type, use the following as a guide:

- **Flat index**: Use for small collections with a known size.
- **HNSW index**: Use for large collections with a known size.
- **Dynamic index**: Use for collections with an unknown size or collections that may grow over time.

Also, in a multi-tenant environment, the "dynamic" index may be a good default choice, as it will allow some tenants to remain in the `flat` index while others are automatically converted to `hnsw` when they grow.
