With Weaviate, you can perform semantic searches to find similar items based on their meaning. This is done by comparing the vector embeddings of the items in the database.

As we are using a multimodal model, we can search for objects based on their similarity to any of the supported modalities. Meaning that we can search for movies based on their similarity to a text or an image.

This example finds entries in "MovieMM" based on their similarity to [this image of the International Space Station](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg/440px-International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg), and prints out the title and release year of the top 5 matches.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

The results are based on similarity of the vector embeddings between the query and the database object. In this case, the vectorizer module generates an embedding of the input image.

The `limit` parameter here sets the maximum number of results to return.

The `return_metadata` parameter takes an instance of the `MetadataQuery` class to set metadata to return in the search results. The current query returns the vector distance to the query.

Note that the results are very similar to the tone of the query image, as the top results are all space-themed movies.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Response object

The returned object is an instance of a custom class. Its `objects` attribute is a list of search results, each object being an instance of another custom class.

Each returned object will:
- Include all properties and its UUID by default except those with blob data types.
    - Since the `poster` property is a blob, it is not included by default.
    - To include the `poster` property, you must specify it and the other properties to fetch in the `return_properties` parameter.
- Not include any other information (e.g. references, metadata, vectors.) by default.

This example finds entries in "MovieMM" based on their similarity to the query "red", and prints out the title and release year of the top 5 matches.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

The results are based on similarity of the vector embeddings between the query and the database object. In this case, the vectorizer module generates an embedding of the input text.

The remaining parameters are the same as in the previous example.

Note that the results actually include movies with red color themes in its poster. This is because the CLIP vectorizer encodes the color information of the image in the vectors.
