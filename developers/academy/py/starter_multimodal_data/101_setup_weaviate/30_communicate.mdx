title: Communicate with Weaviate

import PyCode from '!!raw-loader!../_snippets/101_connect.py';

Here, we'll perform basic operations to communicate with Weaviate using the Python client library.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Check Weaviate status

You can check whether the Weaviate instance is up using the `is_live` function.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# PollLiveness"
  endMarker="# END PollLiveness"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Retrieve server meta information

You can retrieve meta information about the Weaviate instance using the `meta` function.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# GetMeta"
  endMarker="# END GetMeta"
  language="py"
/>

This will print the server meta information to the console. The output will look similar to the following:

<details>
  <summary>Example <code>get_meta</code> output</summary>

Note that this output is a little longer due to the additional details from the CLIP models.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# OutputGetMeta"
  endMarker="# END OutputGetMeta"
  language="py"
/>
</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Close the connection

After you have finished using the Weaviate client, you should close the connection. This frees up resources and ensures that the connection is properly closed.

We suggest using a `try`-`finally` block as a best practice. For brevity, we will not include the `try`-`finally` blocks in the remaining code snippets.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# TryFinallyCloseDemo"
  endMarker="# END TryFinallyCloseDemo"
  language="py"
/>

import { GiscusDocComment } from '/src/components/GiscusComment';

<GiscusDocComment />
