## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i> Course overview

In this project-based course, you will learn how to work with multimodal data using Weaviate and a movie dataset.

You will get hands-on experience on how to store and index text and image data to be searchable together by meaning, using Weaviate's vectorization capabilities. You will learn how to search through that data using multimodal search methods, as well as filters. You will also learn how to use Weaviate's retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities to generate outputs based on the retrieved objects.
