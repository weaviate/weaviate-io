Once a multi-tenant collection has been configured and tenants created, you can interact with each tenant's data very similarly to how you would with a single-tenant collection. This section will show you how to work with data in a multi-tenant collection.

In a single-tenant collection, you would interact with the collection directly. In a multi-tenant collection, you interact with a tenant-level subset of the collection, as shown below:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# GetTenantCollection"
  endMarker="# END GetTenantCollection"
  language="py"
/>
