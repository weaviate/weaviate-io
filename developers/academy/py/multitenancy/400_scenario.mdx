title: Example scenario

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import FilteredTextBlock from '@site/src/components/Documentation/FilteredTextBlock';
import PyCode from '!!raw-loader!./_snippets/400_api_example.py';

To make this more concrete, let's relate the above against a hypothetical application. Imagine you are working with the earlier-discussed `MyPrivateJournal` team.

Each `MyPrivateJournal` end user has their own, journal entries. Weaviate's multi-tenancy collection is perfect for this, as all tenants will have the same configuration, while each tenant's data is isolated from each other.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron"></i> Collection configuration for `MyPrivateJournal`

Their configuration might look as follows:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MyPrivateJournalMTConfig"
  endMarker="# END MyPrivateJournalMTConfig"
  language="py"
/>

This configuration will create a multi-tenant collection with auto-tenant creation and activation enabled.

The "MyPrivateJournal" collection also includes multiple [named vectors](../named_vectors/index.md) per object, which will allow users to search for notes based on the note, tags, or both.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron"></i> Tenant creation & management

The "MyPrivateJournal" team can then create, or otherwise manage tenants to suit their end user events.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Onboarding

The "MyPrivateJournal" team may then create tenants as they onboard new users. For example, they might use logic such as this on a FastAPI back end:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MyPrivateJournalNewUser"
  endMarker="# END MyPrivateJournalNewUser"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Offboarding

If a user requests that their data be deleted, they can similarly be off-boarded.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MyPrivateJournalOffboardUser"
  endMarker="# END MyPrivateJournalOffboardUser"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Set users as inactive

And if a user is inactive for a certain period, the "MyPrivateJournal" team can set them as inactive.

For example, a daily scheduled job may identify users who have not accessed their notes in the last 30 days and set them as inactive:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MyPrivateJournalSetUsersInactive"
  endMarker="# END MyPrivateJournalSetUsersInactive"
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron"></i> Summary

You've seen how the `MyPrivateJournal` team can use Weaviate's multi-tenancy feature to manage their end users' data. This allows them to create, manage, and deactivate tenants as needed, while keeping each tenant's data isolated from each other.

These types of configurations and logic can be adapted to suit your application's needs, to maintain high performance with data isolation, while maximizing value.
