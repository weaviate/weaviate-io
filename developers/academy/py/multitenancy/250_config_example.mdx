title: Example MT configuration

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import FilteredTextBlock from '@site/src/components/Documentation/FilteredTextBlock';
import PyCode from '!!raw-loader!./_snippets/100_config.py';

To make this more concrete, let's relate the above against a hypothetical application. Imagine you are building a note-writing SaaS application ("WeaviNotes").

Each "WeaviNotes" end user will have their own, private notes, where all notes will have the same data structure. Weaviate's multi-tenancy collection is perfect for this, as all tenants will have the same configuration, while each tenant's data is isolated from each other.

Based on the above, let's imagine how the "WeaviNotes" team might configure multi-tenancy.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron"></i> Collection configuration for WeaviNotes

Their configuration might look as follows:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# WeaviNotesMTConfig"
  endMarker="# END WeaviNotesMTConfig"
  language="py"
/>

This configuration will create a multi-tenant collection with auto-tenant creation and activation enabled.

The "WeaviNote" collection also includes multiple [named vectors](../named_vectors/index.md) per object, which will allow users to search for notes based on the note, tags, or both.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron"></i> Tenant creation & management

The "WeaviNotes" team can then create, or otherwise manage tenants to suit their end user events.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Onboarding

The "WeaviNotes" team may then create tenants as they onboard new users. For example, they might use logic such as this on a FastAPI back end:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# WeaviNotesNewUser"
  endMarker="# END WeaviNotesNewUser"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Offboarding

If a user requests that their data be deleted, they can similarly be off-boarded.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# WeaviNotesOffboardUser"
  endMarker="# END WeaviNotesOffboardUser"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Set users as inactive

And if a user is inactive for a certain period, the "WeaviNotes" team can set them as inactive.

For example, a daily scheduled job may identify users who have not accessed their notes in the last 30 days and set them as inactive:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# WeaviNotesSetUsersInactive"
  endMarker="# END WeaviNotesSetUsersInactive"
  language="py"
/>

[Next up](./300_usage.mdx), we'll explore how to use a multi-tenant collection, including data ingestion and query performance.
