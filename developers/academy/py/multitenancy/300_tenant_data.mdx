The team at `MyPrivateJournal` has now set up a Weaviate instance with a multi-tenant collection. In this section, we will learn how to work with tenants and their data.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Add tenants and data

Once a multi-tenant collection is created, you can manage its tenants through the `.tenant` namespace.

Each end user in `MyPrivateJournal` will have their journal entries be backed their own tenant. This means that when a user is onboarded, a tenant is created for them. When a user is offboarded, their tenant is removed.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Create tenants

When a user is onboarded, we can include this code to the onboarding logic.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# BasicTenantCreation"
  endMarker="# END BasicTenantCreation"
  language="py"
/>

Tenant creation can be done in bulk, too.

Let's say that `MyPrivateJournal` has a batch of new users to onboard, from an organization called `AcmeCorp`. They could create tenants for multiple users in one operation:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MultiTenantCreation"
  endMarker="# END MultiTenantCreation"
  language="py"
/>

:::caution Tenant names are case-sensitive
Tenant names are case-sensitive. This means that `steve`, `Steve` and `STEVE` are considered different tenants.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Add data objects

Working with a tenant in a multi-tenant collection is similar to working with a single-tenant collection.

Let's see how `MyPrivateJournal` can work with data objects in a tenant as

#### Single object insertion

As an end user (e.g. Steve or `steve85`) writes a new journal entry, `MyPrivateJournal` can insert it into Steve's tenant.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# SingleObjectInsertion"
  endMarker="# END SingleObjectInsertion"
  language="py"
/>

#### Batch data insertion

And if Steve wants to import his journal entries from another system, `MyPrivateJournal` can insert them in a batch.

<details>
  <summary>Data being inserted</summary>

The objects to be added can be a list of dictionaries, as shown here. Note the use of `datetime` objects with a timezone for `DATE` type properties.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# BatchDataToInsert"
  endMarker="# END BatchDataToInsert"
  language="py"
/>

</details>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# BasicBatchInsertion"
  endMarker="# END BasicBatchInsertion"
  language="py"
/>

#### Bonus: Auto tenant creation

If `MyPrivateJournal` has enabled auto-tenant creation, they can insert data without explicitly creating a tenant. In this example, the specified tenant does not exist, but Weaviate will create it automatically.

This allows `MyPrivateJournal` to delay creating a tenant until the user writes their first journal entry.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# AutoTenantCreationAtInsert"
  endMarker="# END AutoTenantCreationAtInsert"
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Query tenant data

Once Steve's tenant has been created and populated with data, `MyPrivateJournal` can allow Steve to interact with his data.

For an application like this, `MyPrivateJournal` might allow Steve to:

- Retrieve his journal entries for a date range, and
- Search for entries

The good news is that just like our data operations, retrieving and querying data in a tenant is very similar to working with a single-tenant collection.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Retrieve entries for a date range

To retrieve Steve's journal entries for a specific date range, `MyPrivateJournal` can use a query like this:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# DateRangeQuery"
  endMarker="# END DateRangeQuery"
  language="py"
/>

<details>
  <summary>Example response</summary>

Such a query should return a response like:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# ExampleResponseDateRange"
  endMarker="# END ExampleResponseDateRange"
  language="py"
/>
</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Search for entries

Additionally, Steve might want to search for entries. For example - he might want to search for entries relating to some food experience that he had.

`MyPrivateJournal` can leverage Weaviate's `hybrid` search to help Steve find the most relevant entries.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# UserQuery"
  endMarker="# END UserQuery"
  language="py"
/>

<details>
  <summary>Example response</summary>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# ExampleResponseUserQuery"
  endMarker="# END ExampleResponseUserQuery"
  language="json"
/>
</details>

You can see that the search syntax is essentially identical to that of a single-tenant collection. So, any search method available for a single-tenant collection can be applied to a multi-tenant collection.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Summary

In this section, we learned how to work with tenants and their data in a multi-tenant collection. We saw how to create tenants, add data objects, and query tenant data.

In the next section, we will learn how `MyPrivateJournal` can keep their application running smoothly and efficiently by managing tenants.
