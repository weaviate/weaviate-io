Let's see we can build a Weaviate instance to support `MyPrivateJournal`'s requirements.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Project requirements

As a SaaS application, `MyPrivateJournal` has determined that they need the following features:

- **Data isolation**: Each user's data should be private.
- **Efficient scalability**:
    - As `MyPrivateJournal` grows, it should be able to handle tens or hundreds of thousands users.
    - It must be fast for active users, but inactive users should not consume resources.
- **Ease of management**:
    - Adding new users should be simple and fast.
    - Removing users should be straightforward.
- **Flexibility**:
    - It should be efficient for low-volume users as well as high-volume users.
- **Fault tolerance**:
    - A node failure should not lead to complete downtime for a user.
- **Developer experience**:
    - These features should be easy to implement and maintain.

After reviewing potential solutions, we determined that Weaviate with multi-tenant collections can meet these challenges. Let's see how we can implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) solution for `MyPrivateJournal`.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Weaviate configuration

As a development setup, we will use a local Weaviate instance with Docker. This will allow us to quickly set up a Weaviate instance for development and testing.

Here is our `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
---
services:
  weaviate_anon:
    command:
    - --host
    - 0.0.0.0
    - --port
    - '8080'
    - --scheme
    - http
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    - 50051:50051
    restart: on-failure:0

      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: 'none'

...
```

  <summary>What about a multi-node setup?</summary>

Great question! As you probably noticed, we are using a single-node setup here for simplicity.
<br/>

But we can easily extend this to a multi-node setup by adding additional services. This will allow you to scale your Weaviate instance horizontally, and provide fault tolerance with replication.
<br/>

For example, here is a multi-node setup with three nodes.

```yaml

  weaviate-node-1:  # Founding member service name

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Configuration highlights

You may have seen Docker configurations elsewhere ([e.g. Docs](../../../weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md), [Academy](../starter_text_data/101_setup_weaviate/20_create_instance/20_create_docker.mdx)). But these highlighted configurations may be new to you:

- `ASYNC_INDEXING`: This will enable asynchronous indexing. This is useful for high-volume data insertion, and enables us to use the `dynamic` index type, which you will learn about later on.
- `ENABLE_MODULES`: We enable `offload-s3` to demonstrate tenant offloading later on. Offloading helps us to manage inactive users' data efficiently.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: These are the AWS credentials that Weaviate will use to access the S3 bucket.
- `OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET_AUTO_CREATE`: This will automatically create the S3 bucket if it does not exist.

Save the file to `docker-compose.yaml`, and run the following command to start Weaviate:

```bash
docker compose up
```

import OffloadingLimitation from '/_includes/offloading-limitation.mdx';

<OffloadingLimitation/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Your Weaviate instance details

Once the instance is created, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

Now, we are ready to create a collection for `MyPrivateJournal`.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Create a collection

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Enable multi-tenancy

A collection must be specified as multi-tenant when it is created. So, we enable multi-tenancy in the collection configuration.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MTConfig"
  endMarker="# END MTConfig"
  language="py"
/>

We also set `auto_tenant_creation` and `auto_tenant_activation` here to `true`. You'll learn more about these features later on. But here is a brief overview:

- `auto_tenant_activation`: if `true`, activate any deactivated (`INACTIVE` or `OFFLOADED`) tenants when they are accessed.
- `auto_tenant_creation`: if `true`, automatically create the tenant when an object is inserted against a non-existent tenant.

You will see these features in action later on.

<details>
  <summary>More about <code>auto_tenant_creation</code></summary>

:::info Added in `v1.25`
The auto tenant creation feature is available from `v1.25.0` for batch imports, and from `v1.25.2` for single object insertions.
:::

Enabling `auto_tenant_creation` will cause Weaviate to automatically create the tenant when an object is inserted against a non-existent tenant.
<br/>

This option is particularly useful for bulk data ingestion, as it removes the need to create the tenant prior to object insertion. Instead, `auto_tenant_creation` will allow the object insertion process to continue without interruption.
<br/>

A risk of using `auto_tenant_creation` is that an error in the source data will not be caught during import. For example, a source object with erroneously spelt `"TenntOn"` instead of `"TenantOne"` will create a new tenant for `"TenntOne"` instead of raising an error.
<br/>

The server-side default for `auto_tenant_creation` is `false`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>More about <code>auto_tenant_activation</code></summary>

:::info Added in `v1.25.2`
The auto tenant activation feature is available from `v1.25.2`.
:::

If `auto_tenant_activation` is enabled, Weaviate will automatically activate any deactivated (`INACTIVE` or `OFFLOADED`) tenants when they are accessed.
<br/>

This option is particularly useful for scenarios where you have a large number of tenants, but only a subset of them are active at any given time. An example is a SaaS app where some tenants may be unlikely due to their local time zone, or their recent activity level.
<br/>

By enabling `auto_tenant_activation`, you can safely set those less active users to be inactive, knowing that they will be loaded onto memory once requested.
<br/>

This can help to reduce the memory footprint of your Weaviate instance, as only the active tenants are loaded into memory.
<br/>

The server-side default for `auto_tenant_activation` is `false`.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Configure vector index

From what we know about other journal use cases, a majority of users will only have a small number of entries. But, a few of those users may have a large number of entries.

This is a tricky situation to balance. If we use a `hnsw` index, it will be fast for users with many entries, but it will require a lot of memory. If we use a `flat` index, it will require less memory, but potentially slower for users with many entries.

What we can do here is to choose a `dynamic` index. A `dynamic` index will automatically switch from `flat` to `hnsw` once it passes a threshold count. This way, we can balance the memory usage and speed for our users.

Here is an example code snippet, configuring a "note" named vector with a `dynamic` index.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# DynamicIndexConfig"
  endMarker="# END DynamicIndexConfig"
  language="py"
/>

Note (no pun intended) that the `dynamic` index configuration accepts both `flat` and `hnsw` index configurations. Each index configuration is used when the `dynamic` index is in that state.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Full code snippet

Here is the complete code snippet to create the collection. Take a look at the configuration and see if you agree with our choices.

In our PoC, we create just the one collection (`"JournalEntry"`), with `"text"`, `"date"`, and `"tags"` properties to keep things simple.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MTFullCollectionCreation"
  endMarker="# END MTFullCollectionCreation"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Summary

In this section, we set up a Weaviate instance with multi-tenancy enabled. We also created a collection for `MyPrivateJournal`, with multi-tenancy and a dynamic index configuration.

Now, the `MyPrivateJournal` team can start onboarding users and storing their journal entries in the collection.
