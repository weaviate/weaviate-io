## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Tenant activity statuses

As `MyPrivateJournal` grows the team notices that the resource requirements and associated costs are growing.

Meanwhile, the team also notices these usage patterns:

- Many users use the application for small parts of the day, and then log off.
- Some users are infrequent, accessing the service only occasionally.
- Some users drop off after a while, and their data is not accessed for a long time.

Weaviate's multi-tenancy features can help `MyPrivateJournal` manage these usage patterns more effectively. Let's see how:

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Introduction to tenant activity statuses

But first, let's talk a little about tenant activity statuses. Up to now, you've worked with tenants without specifying an activity status. This creates an `ACTIVE` tenant by default.

But a tenant can be set to have an `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, or `OFFLOADED` status.

| Tenant state     | CRUD & Queries | Vector Index | Inverted Index | Object Data | Time to Activate | Tenant description |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Active (default) | **Yes**        | Hot/Warm     | Warm           | Warm        | None             | Available for use |
| Inactive         | **No**         | Warm         | Warm           | Warm        | Fast             | Not available for use, stored locally |
| Offloaded        | **No**         | Cold         | Cold           | Cold        | Slow             | Not available for use, stored on the cloud |

These states are mutable, letting you manage your tenants more effectively, balancing cost, availability and performance.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Manage tenant activity statuses

So, you might start to see how `MyPrivateJournal` can leverage tenant activity statues to improve their operational efficiency.

#### Deactivate a tenant

Since `INACTIVE` tenants use less resources than `ACTIVE` tenants, `MyPrivateJournal` can deactivate tenants that are unlikely to be immediately accessed.

One example is a user who's just logged out of the application. We could set their tenant to `INACTIVE` as a part of the logout process:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# UpdateOneTenantStatus"
  endMarker="# END UpdateOneTenantStatus"
  language="py"
/>

#### Deactivate multiple tenants

`MyPrivateJournal` can also deactivate multiple tenants at once. For example, they could deactivate all tenants for their local night time, or those who have not logged on for over 7 days:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# UpdateMultipleTenantStatuses"
  endMarker="# END UpdateMultipleTenantStatuses"
  language="py"
/>

#### Offload tenants

`MyPrivateJournal` can also offload tenants to the cloud. This is useful for tenants that are unlikely to be accessed in the near future.

For example, they could offload tenants that have not been accessed for over 30 days:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# OffloadMultipleTenants"
  endMarker="# END OffloadMultipleTenants"
  language="py"
/>

This will move the tenant's data to cold storage, freeing up hot and warm resources. In turn, the overall system requirements and cost will be lowered.

<OffloadingLimitation/>

The ability to offload tenants to cold storage is a powerful feature that can help you manage your Weaviate instance's resource usage.
<br/>

To use tenant offloading in Weaviate, you need enable a relevant offloading [module](../../../weaviate/configuration/modules.md). Depending on whether your deployment is on Docker or Kubernetes, you can enable the `offload-s3` module as shown below.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

```yaml
services:
  weaviate:
    environment:
      # highlight-start
      ENABLE_MODULES: 'offload-s3' # plus other modules you may need
      OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET: 'weaviate-offload' # the name of the S3 bucket
      OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET_AUTO_CREATE: 'true' # create the bucket if it does not exist
      # highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

```yaml
offload:
  s3:
    enabled: true  # Set this value to true to enable the offload-s3 module
    envconfig:
      OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET: weaviate-offload  # the name of the S3 bucket
      OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET_AUTO_CREATE: true  # create the bucket if it does not exist
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the target S3 bucket does not exist, the `OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET_AUTO_CREATE` variable must be set to `true` so that Weaviate can create the bucket automatically.
<br/>

#### AWS permissions

You must provide Weaviate with AWS authentication details. You can choose between access-key or ARN-based authentication.
<br/>

:::tip Requirements
The Weaviate instance must have the [necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-policy-language-overview.html).
- The provided AWS identity must be able to write to the bucket.
- If `OFFLOAD_S3_BUCKET_AUTO_CREATE` is set to `true`, the AWS identity must have permission to create the bucket.
:::

**Option 1: With IAM and ARN roles**
<br/>

The backup module will first try to authenticate itself using AWS IAM. If the authentication fails then it will try to authenticate with `Option 2`.
<br/>

**Option 2: With access key and secret access key**
<br/>

| Environment variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | The id of the AWS access key for the desired account. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The secret AWS access key for the desired account. |
| `AWS_REGION` | (Optional) The AWS Region. If not provided, the module will try to parse `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. |

Once the `offload-s3` module is enabled, you can offload tenants to the S3 bucket by [setting their activity status](#update-tenants) to `OFFLOADED`, or load them back to local storage by setting their status to `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`.

</details>

#### Activate users

And then, `MyPrivateJournal` can activate tenants as required. For example, they could activate a tenant when the user logs in, or based on their local time in an inverse pattern to deactivation:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# ActivateMultipleTenants"
  endMarker="# END ActivateMultipleTenants"
  language="py"
/>

#### Leverage auto-activation

There may also be cases where a user attempts to perform a query on an `INACTIVE` tenant.

This may sound like a problem, but Weaviate can automatically activate the tenant for the query, if the collection was created with `auto_tenant_activation` enabled (which [we did do earlier](./200_setup.mdx#create-a-collection)).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Offboard users

As with all SaaS applications, `MyPrivateJournal` will need to offboard users from time to time. This could be due to a user request, or any other reason for account deletion.

In a multi-tenant collection, offboarding a user can easily be done by removing their tenant. This will delete the tenant and all its data.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# RemoveTenants"
  endMarker="# END RemoveTenants"
  language="py"
/>

The `MyPrivateJournal` engineers could set up its offboarding system to remove a user's tenant when they delete their account or request data deletion. This will ensure that the user's data is removed from the system.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Summary

In this section, you learned how to manage tenants in a multi-tenant collection. You saw how to:

- Update a tenant's activity status
- Offload tenants to cold storage
- Activate tenants as required
- Remove tenants from the system

These features can help `MyPrivateJournal` manage its resource usage more effectively, and provide a better experience for its users.
