title: Tokenization in practice
---

Now that you've learned about different tokenization methods, let's put them into practice. In this section, you'll see how tokenization impacts search results in Weaviate.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Preparation

For this section, we'll work with an actual Weaviate instance to see how different tokenization methods impact search results.

We are only going to use a very small dataset for demonstration purposes. You can use the following Python code to add this data to your Weaviate instance. But alternatively, you could access the data in the pre-populated Weaviate instance.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Add collection

We will add a very simple collection, with each object containing multiple properties. Each properties will contain the same text, but with different tokenization methods applied.

Note that we do not add object vectors in this case, as we are only interested in the impact of tokenization on keyword search results.

Now, we add objects to the collection, repeating text objects as properties.
