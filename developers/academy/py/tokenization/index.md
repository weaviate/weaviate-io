:::info Pre-requisites
This course is self-contained. However, we recommend that you go through one of the 101-level courses, such as that for working with [text](../starter_text_data/index.md), [your own vectors](../starter_custom_vectors/index.md), or [multimodal data](../starter_multimodal_data/index.md).
:::

This course will introduce you to tokenization, and how it relates to Weaviate. Specifically, it will discuss what it is, how it relates to search and how to configure it.

Note that tokenization is a concept that applies to keyword search and filtering, as well as in the context of language models.

**This course focuses on the keyword aspect**, but will briefly discuss how tokenization impacts language models.
