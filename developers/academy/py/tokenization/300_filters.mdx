Now that you've learned about different tokenization methods, let's put them into practice. In this section, you'll see how tokenization impacts filters.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Preparation

For this section, we'll work with an actual Weaviate instance to see how different tokenization methods impact filtering results.

We are going to use a very small, custom dataset for demonstration purposes.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyAddObjects}
  startMarker="# StringsToAdd"
  endMarker="# END StringsToAdd"
  language="py"
/>

To follow along, you can use the following Python code to add this data to your Weaviate instance.

<details>
  <summary>Steps to create a collection</summary>

We will create a simple object collection, with each object containing multiple properties. Each properties will contain the same text, but with different tokenization methods applied.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCreateCollection}
  startMarker="# CreateDemoCollection"
  endMarker="# END CreateDemoCollection"
  language="py"
/>

Note that we do not add object vectors in this case, as we are only interested in the impact of tokenization on filters (and keyword searches).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Steps to add objects</summary>

Now, we add objects to the collection, repeating text objects as properties.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyAddObjects}
  startMarker="# AddObjects"
  endMarker="# END AddObjects"
  language="py"
/>

</details>


## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Impact on filters

Now that we have added a set of objects to Weaviate, let's see how different tokenization methods impact filtered retrieval.

Each filtered query will look something like this, wherein we filter the objects for a set of query strings.

We'll set up a reusable function to filter objects based on a set of query strings. Remember that a filter is binary: it either matches or it doesn't.

The function will return a list of matched objects, and print the matched objects for us to see.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# FilterExampleBasic"
  endMarker="# END FilterExampleBasic"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> "**Clark:** "vs "**clark**" - messy text

Typical text is often messy, with punctuations, mixed cases and other irregularities. Take a look at this example, where we filter for various combinations of substrings from the TV show title `"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"`.

The table shows whether the query matched the title:

|               | `word` | `lowercase` | `whitespace` | `field` |
|---------------|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `"clark"`       | ✅     | ❌         | ❌          | ❌     |
| `"Clark"`       | ✅     | ❌         | ❌          | ❌     |
| `"clark:" `     | ✅     | ✅         | ❌          | ❌     |
| `"Clark:" `     | ✅     | ✅         | ✅          | ❌     |
| `"lois clark"`  | ✅     | ❌         | ❌          | ❌     |
| `"clark lois"`  | ✅     | ❌         | ❌          | ❌     |

<details>
  <summary>Python query & output</summary>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# ClarkExample"
  endMarker="# END ClarkExample"
  language="py"
/>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# ClarkResults"
  endMarker="# END ClarkResults"
  language="text"
/>

</details>

Note how the `word` tokenization was the only that consistently returned the matching title, unless the colon (`:`) was included in the query. This is because the `word` tokenization method treats the colon as a separator.

Users may not be expected to include any punctuation in their queries, nor the exact capitalization. As a result, for a typical text filter usage, the `word` tokenization method is a good starting point.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> "**A mouse**" vs "**mouse**" - stop words

Here, we filter for variants of the phrase "computer mouse", where some queries include additional words.

Now, take a look at the results.

**Matches for `"computer mouse"`**

|                              | `word`    | `lowercase` | `whitespace` | `field` |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `"computer mouse"`           | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ✅     |
| `"a computer mouse"`         | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ❌     |
| `"the computer mouse:" `     | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ❌     |
| `"blue computer mouse" `     | ❌        | ❌           | ❌           | ❌     |

**Matches for `"a computer mouse"`**

|                              | `word`    | `lowercase` | `whitespace` | `field` |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `"computer mouse"`           | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ❌     |
| `"a computer mouse"`         | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ✅     |
| `"the computer mouse:" `     | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ❌     |
| `"blue computer mouse" `     | ❌        | ❌           | ❌           | ❌     |

<details>
  <summary>Python query & output</summary>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# MouseExample"
  endMarker="# END MouseExample"
  language="py"
/>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# MouseResults"
  endMarker="# END MouseResults"
  language="text"
/>

</details>

The results indicate that adding the word "a" or "the" to the query does not impact the filter results for all methods except `field`. This is because at every tokenization method, the word "a" or "the" is considered a stop word and is ignored.

With the `field` method, the difference is that stop word tokens like "a" or "the" are never produced. An input "a computer mouse" is tokenized to `["a computer mouse"]`, containing one token.

Adding another word, such as "blue", that is not a stop word, causes the query to not match any objects.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> "**variable_name**" vs "**variable name**" - symbols

The `word` tokenization is a good default. However, it may not always be the best choice. Take a look at this example where we filter for different variants of `"variable_name"`, to see if they match the object with the exact string (`"variable_name"`).

|                              | `word`    | `lowercase` | `whitespace` | `field` |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `"variable_name"`            | ✅        | ✅           | ✅           | ✅     |
| `"Variable_Name:" `          | ✅        | ✅           | ❌           | ❌     |
| `"Variable Name:" `          | ✅        | ❌           | ❌           | ❌     |
| `"a_variable_name"`          | ✅        | ❌           | ❌           | ❌     |
| `"the_variable_name"`        | ✅        | ❌           | ❌           | ❌     |
| `"variable_new_name" `       | ✅        | ❌           | ❌           | ❌     |

<details>
  <summary>Python query & output</summary>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# UnderscoreExample"
  endMarker="# END UnderscoreExample"
  language="py"
/>

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyFilters}
  startMarker="# UnderscoreResults"
  endMarker="# END UnderscoreResults"
  language="text"
/>

</details>

What is the desired behavior here? Should a filter for `"variable name"` match the object with the property `"variable_name"`?

What about a filter for `"variable_new_name"`? If the goal is to look through, say, a code base, the user might not expect a filter for `"variable_new_name"` to match `"variable_name"`.

In cases such as these, where symbols are important to your data, you should consider using a tokenization method that preserves symbols, such as `lowercase` or `whitespace`.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Discussions

We've discussed how different tokenization methods impact filters.

For most filtering use, the `word` tokenization method is a good starting point. It is case-insensitive, and treats most symbols as separators.

However, if symbols are important to your data, or if you need to distinguish between different cases, you may want to consider using a different tokenization method.

And what about `field` tokenization? This method is most useful when you have text that should be treated as a single token. This is useful for properties like email addresses, URLs, or identifiers.

A typical filtering strategy with a `field` tokenization method might involve exact matches, or partial matches with wildcards. Do note, however, that wildcard-based filters can be computationally expensive (slow) - so use them judiciously.

Next, we'll discuss how tokenization impacts keyword searches.
