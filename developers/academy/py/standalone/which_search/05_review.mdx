## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Overview

Weaviate offers three primary search types - namely **vector**, **keyword**, and **hybrid** searches. Let's briefly recap what they are, and how they work.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code examples

These code examples are runnable, with the [`v4` Weaviate Python client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python/index.md). Connect to the pre-configured demo instance of Weaviate with the following code, and try the examples below.

<Tabs groupId="languages">

 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START connectionCode"
      endMarker="# END connectionCode"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Vector search

A vector search finds objects with the most similar vectors to the query vector.

Because each vector is a numerical representation of the underlying object, a vector similarity can be thought of as a similarity in meaning. Therefore a vector search is also called "semantic search".

In Weaviate, you can search for objects with similar vectors in any of the following ways:

With a source medium (e.g. text or image):

<Tabs groupId="languages">

 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START nearTextExample"
      endMarker="# END nearTextExample"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

With a vector:

<Tabs groupId="languages">

 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START nearVectorExample"
      endMarker="# END nearVectorExample"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

With an existing Weaviate object:

<Tabs groupId="languages">

 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START nearObjectExample"
      endMarker="# END nearObjectExample"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Keyword search

A keyword search finds objects whose keywords (i.e. tokens) are the most relevant to the keywords (i.e. tokens) of the query. The relevance is determined by the [BM25F algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25).

Intuitively, the BM25F algorithm determines "relevance" by considering how often a keyword appears in each field of the object, relative to how commonly the keyword appears in the entire dataset.

<Tabs groupId="languages">

 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START bm25Example"
      endMarker="# END bm25Example"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Hybrid search

A hybrid search combines the results of a vector search and a keyword search. This is done by performing both searches, and them combining the two search results with a "fusion" algorithm.

<Tabs groupId="languages">

 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START hybridExample"
      endMarker="# END hybridExample"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
