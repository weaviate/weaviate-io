Weaviate offers three distinct search methods - namely **vector**, **keyword**, and **hybrid** searches.

Each method has its unique strengths and applicabilities, making the selection critical to the success of your search-related tasks.

This section compares these search types to equip you with the knowledge to intuit when and why to employ each of these search methodologies.

We will explore how the choice of search type impacts not only the quality of the search results but also the overall performance of the search operation.

Then, we will also discuss strategies to improve the quality of search results, as well as the performance of the search operation.
