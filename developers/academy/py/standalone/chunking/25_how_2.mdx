## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Overview

We continue our discussion of chunking techniques by taking you through **variable-size** chunking techniques, including some example implementations.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Variable-size chunking

Now let's look at variable-size chunking. Unlike fixed-size chunking, the chunk size here is an *outcome*, rather than an *input parameter*.

In variable-size chunking, some marker is used to split the text. The marker may be syntactic, such as a sentence or paragraph marker, or even structural such as a markdown header.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Implementations

A pseudocode implementation of variable-size chunking could look like this:

```python
# Given a text of length L
# Identify a marker (e.g. full-stop, paragraph marker (two newlines), or a Markdown header
# Split the text into chunks at each marker
```

Which could be implemented in Python as below:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeVariableSizeChunking}
  startMarker="# START Paragraph variable size chunker"
  endMarker="# END Paragraph variable size chunker"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or, we could use special markers - such as Markdown headers - to split the text.

(Since the *Pro Git* book is written in [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/), we'll use Asciidoc headers instead - they all start with new lines followed by `==`.)

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeVariableSizeChunking}
  startMarker="# START Asciidoc section variable size chunker"
  endMarker="# END Asciidoc section variable size chunker"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Again, let's now apply these to concrete examples.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Examples

We can apply these splitters to the same text as before.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeVariableSizeChunking}
  startMarker="# START Get variable-size chunks examples"
  endMarker="# END Get variable-size chunks examples"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

And the outputs look like this. Now, what do you observe?

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="para" label="By paragraph">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeVariableSizeChunking}
  startMarker="# START Chunking by paragraph - outputs"
  endMarker="# END Chunking by paragraph - outputs"
  language="text"
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="header" label="By header">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeVariableSizeChunking}
  startMarker="# START Chunking by header - outputs"
  endMarker="# END Chunking by header - outputs"
  language="text"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

One thing that might stand out immediately is that both of our very simple marker-based chunker ends up extracting the heading as one chunk, which may not be desirable.

In reality, you may employ a mixed strategy where very short chunks like this may be appended to the next chunk, assuming that it is likely to be something like a title, or a section heading.

Let's take a look at such a strategy.


## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Mixed strategy

You could use a mix of fixed-size chunking and variable-size chunking to get the best of both worlds. For example, you could use a variable-size chunker to split the chunks at paragraph markers, but apply a fixed-size filter.

More specifically, any chunks that are too small could be merged with the next chunk, and/or any chunks that are too large could be split at the middle, or at another marker within the chunk.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Examples

One implementation may look as follows:

```python
# Given a text of length L
# Identify a marker (e.g. full-stop, paragraph marker (two newlines), or a Markdown header
# Split the text into chunks at each marker
# If any of the chunks are too small, merge them with the next chunk
# If any of the chunks are too large, split them - e.g. at the middle or using another marker within the chunk
```

Which could be implemented in Python like this:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">
<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeMixedStrategyChunking}
  startMarker="# START Asciidoc and size based chunking"
  endMarker="# END Asciidoc and size based chunking"
  language="py"
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Producing these chunks.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={CodeMixedStrategyChunking}
  startMarker="# START Mixed-strategy chunking output"
  endMarker="# END Mixed-strategy chunking output"
  language="text"
/>

This strategy will not produce chunks that are too small, while still basing them based on a syntactic marker, respecting the boundary of a heading.

Since we've seen chunking strategies in action on a single text, let's now look at how they may work on a larger set of texts. We'll also take a look at what retrieval results may look like, using different chunking strategies.
