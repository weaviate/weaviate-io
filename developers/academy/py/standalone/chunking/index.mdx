Chunking is an important concept in the world of vector databases and language models. Although we've looked at relatively small pieces of text in previous units, real-world text data can be much longer.

Think about lengths of articles, transcripts, or even books. Instead of a few words, these texts can be thousands, or tens of thousands of words long if not longer. *The Lord of the Rings*, for example, is over 500,000 words long!

Chunking splits texts like these into smaller pieces of texts, i.e. "chunks", before storing them in a vector database, or passing them to a language model.

This can seem relatively innocuous at first. Like deciding where to split a sentence or a paragraph into two. But the choice of chunking strategy can have a significant impact on the final results.

Although this may seem glance, chunking decisions can significantly impact the search performance and behavior of vector databases as well as outputs language models. This unit covers this seemingly simple, but nuanced topic from the perspective of a user. We will begin by covering what chunking is, and why it is used.

We will then move on to cover various chunking methods before discussing key considerations when deciding on a chunking strategy, as well as some suggested starting points.

By the end of this unit, you will have a good understanding of chunking in general, and be able to implement some solid chunking strategies based on your actual needs.
