Since we are using custom vectors, we need to generate them ourselves.

This step is optional, as the next section shows you how to download and use the pre-generated vectors. But if you are interested in how to generate vectors, read on.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

This example creates embeddings for the movie dataset:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# ManuallyGenerateEmbeddings"
  endMarker="# END ManuallyGenerateEmbeddings"
  language="py"
/>

This will generate a vector for each movie in the dataset, which we can use when adding the movies to Weaviate.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Model

We use the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to generate the vectors. We access it here through the Hugging Face API for convenience. You could also use the `transformers` library, if you would like to perform the generation locally.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Source text

We combine the movie title and overview to create a source string for the model. This is the text that the model will "translate" into a vector.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# Concatenate text to create a source string"
  endMarker="# Add to the buffer"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Get embeddings in batches

We use a buffer to store the concatenated strings, and then get the embeddings in batches. This is a good practice to limit the number of requests to the model, and to avoid timeouts.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# Get a batch of embeddings"
  endMarker="# Reset the buffer"
  language="py"
/>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Export the embeddings

The embeddings are then saved to a file so that we can use when adding the movies to Weaviate.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# Save the data as a CSV"
  endMarker="# END ManuallyGenerateEmbeddings"
  language="py"
/>
