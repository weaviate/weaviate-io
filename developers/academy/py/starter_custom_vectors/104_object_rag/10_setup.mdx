### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Motivation

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a way to combine the best of both worlds: the retrieval capabilities of semantic search and the generation capabilities of AI models such as large language models. This allows you to retrieve objects from a Weaviate instance and then generate outputs based on the retrieved objects.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Setup

When we created a collection, we specified the `generative_module` parameter as shown here.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# Define the generative module"
  endMarker="# END generativeDefinition"
  language="py"
/>

This selects a generative module that will be used to generate outputs based on the retrieved objects. In this case, we're using the `openai` module, and the `GPT` family of large language models.

As we did before with the vectorizer module, you will require an API key from the provider of the generative module. In this case, you will need an API key from OpenAI.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> RAG queries

RAG queries are also called 'generative' queries in Weaviate. You can access these functions through the `generate` submodule of the collection object.

Each generative query works in addition to the regular search query, and will perform a RAG query on each retrieved object.
