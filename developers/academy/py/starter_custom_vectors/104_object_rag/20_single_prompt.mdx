A 'single prompt' generation wil perform RAG queries on each retrieved object. This is useful when you want to transform each object separately, with the same prompt.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

This example finds entries in "Movie" based on their similarity to the input vector. Then, instructs the large language model to translate the title of each movie into French.

Each of the results are then printed out to the console.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# SinglePromptGeneration"
  endMarker="# END SinglePromptGeneration"
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

You must pass on one or more properties to the `single_prompt` parameter through braces, as we've done here with `"... {title} ..."`. This will instruct Weaviate to pass on the `title` property from each retrieved object to the large language model.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Response object

Each response object is similar to that from a regular search query, with an additional `generated` attribute. This attribute will contain the generated output for each object.
