A 'grouped task' generation wil perform RAG queries on the set of retrieved objects. This is useful when you want to transform the set of objects as a whole, with one prompt.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

This example finds entries in "Movie" based on their similarity to the input vector. Then, instructs the large language model to find commonalities between them.

The generated text, and each of the results are then printed out to the console.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# GroupedTaskGeneration"
  endMarker="# END GroupedTaskGeneration"
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

For `grouped_task` queries, you simply pass on the prompt to the `grouped_task` parameter. This will instruct Weaviate to pass on the:
- text properties from all retrieved objects, and
- the prompt

to the large language model.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Optional parameters

You can also pass on a list of properties to be used, as the `grouped_properties` parameter. This can be useful to reduce the amount of data passed on to the large language model and omit irrelevant properties.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Response object

A RAG query with the `grouped_task` parameter will return a response with an additional `generated` attribute. This attribute will contain the generated output for the set of objects.
