## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Course overview

In this project-based course, you will learn how to work with any data and your own vectors, using Weaviate and a pre-vectorized movie dataset.

You will get hands-on experience on how to store and index objects and corresponding vectors. You will learn how to search through that data using vector, keyword and hybrid searches, as well as filters. You will also learn how to use Weaviate's retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities to generate outputs based on the retrieved objects.
