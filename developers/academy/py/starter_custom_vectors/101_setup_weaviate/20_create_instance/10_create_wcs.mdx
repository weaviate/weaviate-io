Here, you will create a Weaviate Cloud (WCD) instance. WCD is a fully managed Weaviate instance that runs in the cloud. It's a great way to get started with Weaviate, as it requires no installation or maintenance.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Log in to the WCD Console

Go to the [WCD Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and log in with your credentials. If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up by clicking on the <kbd>Register here</kbd> link from the login screen.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Create a Weaviate instance

From the console, go to the Dashboard and click on the <kbd>Create cluster</kbd> button. From the following screen:

- Select the "Free sandbox" tab
- Provide a cluster name
- Set "Enable authentication" to "Yes"

Click on the <kbd>Create</kbd> button to create your Weaviate instance. The process will take a few minutes.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Retrieve your Weaviate instance details

Once the instance is created, you will be able see its details by clicking on the <kbd>Details</kbd> button. Find the cluster URL and the API key.

You will need these details to connect to your Weaviate instance.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Connect to your WCD instance

To connect to the Weaviate Cloud (WCD) instance, you need to use the cluster URL and the API key. You can find these details in the WCD Console.

Use the `connect_to_weaviate_cloud` function to connect to your WCD instance.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# WCDInstantiation"
  endMarker="# END WCDInstantiation"
  language="py"
/>

#### Provide inference API keys

Some Weaviate modules can use inference APIs for vectorizing data or large language model integration. You can provide the API keys for these services to Weaviate at instantiation.

This course uses Cohere, so you can provide the Cohere API key to Weaviate through `headers={"X-Cohere-Api-Key": <YOUR_KEY>}` as shown below:

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# WCDAPIKeyInstantiation"
  endMarker="# END WCDAPIKeyInstantiation"
  language="py"
/>
