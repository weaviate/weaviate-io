With Weaviate, you can perform semantic searches to find similar items based on their meaning. This is done by comparing the vector embeddings of the items in the database.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Code

This example finds entries in "Movie" based on their similarity to the query "dystopian future", and prints out the title and release year of the top 5 matches.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PyCode}
  startMarker="# MetadataSemanticSearch"
  endMarker="# END MetadataSemanticSearch"
  language="py"
/>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Explain the code

The results are based on similarity of the vector embeddings between the query and the database object text. In this case, the embeddings are generated by the vectorizer module.

The `limit` parameter here sets the maximum number of results to return.

The `return_metadata` parameter takes an instance of the `MetadataQuery` class to set metadata to return in the search results. The current query returns the vector distance to the query.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Response object

The returned object is an instance of a custom class. Its `objects` attribute is a list of search results, each object being an instance of another custom class.

Each returned object will:
- Include all properties and its UUID by default except those with blob data types.
- Not include any other information (e.g. references, metadata, vectors.) by default.
