## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Using Fullstack Frameworks

This approach involves having a single tool to build both your server application and client application. In modern web development terms, such a tool is called a fullstack web frameworks. For this example, we will be using [Nuxt.js](nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)


### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Using Next.js

#### 1. Create a Next.js application with the command below.

```bash
create-next-app <project-name> –ts –app
```
#### 2. Install relevant project dependencies including the Weaviate client with the command below. 

```bash
npm install weaviate-client 
```

#### 2. Create your project credentials including..
- Your Weaviate cluster URL and API key
- Your Cohere API key

... and add them to a `.env` file.

#### 3. Initialize Weaviate 

Create a file in `utils/weaviate.ts` and paste the following code

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(process.env.WEAVIATE_HOST_URL as string,{
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey(process.env.WEAVIATE_ADMIN_KEY as string),
    headers: {
      'X-Cohere-Api-Key': process.env.COHERE_API_KEY as string
    }
  },
);
```

#### 4. Create an action to run on the server

Next in `./utils/action.ts`, paste the following code.
```ts
"use server";

import { connectToDB } from './weaviate.ts'

export async function vectorSearch(searchTerm: string) {
  
  const myCollection = client.collections.get('MyCollectionName');

  const response = await myCollection.query.nearText(searchTerm, {
      limit: 8,
      returnMetadata: ['distance'],
    })

  return response
  }
```

#### 5. Fetch data from your server in your client application. 
In the `./app` folder, paste the following code in `page.tsx`
```tsx

import { vectorSearch } from '@/utils/action.ts';

export default async function Home() {
  const search = "water sports i can win a medal in"
  const data = await vectorSearch(search);

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <h1>
          { data }
          </h1>
        </body>
    </html>
  )

}
      
```

et voila. Find a fully working application here to try out and build from as you see you fit.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Using Nuxt.js

#### 1. Create a Nuxt.js application with the command below.
```bash
npx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```
#### 2. Install relevant project dependencies including the Weaviate client with the command below. 
```bash
npm install weaviate-client dotenv zod tsc
```
#### 2. Create your project credentials including..
- Your Weaviate cluster URL and API key
- Your Cohere API key

Add your env vars to your `..env` file and follow the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/env) convention on environment variables.

#### 3. Create a API route to server requests from the client

In `server/api` create a file called `search.ts`

```ts

import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from "weaviate-client"
import { z } from 'zod'

export default defineLazyEventHandler(async () => {
  const config = useRuntimeConfig()

const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(config.weaviateHostURL,{
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey(config.weaviateReadKey),
    headers: {
      'X-Cohere-Api-Key': config.cohereApiKey,
 }
 }
)

const responseSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string(),
})

async function vectorSearch(searchTerm:string) {
  const myProductCollection = client.collections.get('TestProduct')

const response = await myProductCollection.query.nearText(searchTerm, { limit : 10 })

return response.objects


}

  return defineEventHandler<{query: { query: string } }>(async (event) => {
  
    const result = await getValidatedQuery(event, body => responseSchema.safeParse(body))
    if (!result.success)
      throw result.error.issues
  
    const searchTerm = result.data.query
  
    return await vectorSearch(searchTerm)
 })
})

```

#### 4. Fetch data from your server in your client application. 

In `app.vue` paste the following code.

```html
<template>
    <div>
        {{ searchResult }}
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { nextTick } from 'vue';

const searchTerm = ref('water sports i can win a medal in')
const searchResult = ref()

let products = ref({});

onMounted(async () => {
    await nextTick();
    searchResult.value = await $fetch(`/api/search?query=${searchTerm.value}`)
});

</script>

```

et voila.. Find a fully working application here to try out and build from as you see you fit.

Although only detailing these, you can build with Weaviate using the following fullstack frameworks.

- Solid
- Angular

To mention a few.
