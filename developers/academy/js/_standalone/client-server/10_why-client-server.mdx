### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> What is the client-server architecture

A client-server application is one that runs on a client device while accessing information from a remote server.

In the context of building applications with Weaviate, this means you would have a server as an intermediary to handle all interactions with your database as opposed to interacting with your database directly from your client application.

This section aims to guide you through how to do that as you build applications with the Weaviate Typescript v3 client: [weaviate-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-client).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Why client-server


Besides the requirements of running the [weaviate-client](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3#node-support-only), the client-server architecture is reliably more secure than interactions directly from the client.

Having a client-server approach means you can optimize your use of Weaviate by implementing one or more of the following..

- Load Balancing 
- User and Session Management
- Security related Middleware

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Using the weaviate-client 

Install the client by following these instructions. A big benefit of using the new v3 client is the introduction of the gRPC protocol. A fast, more reliable platform to handle interactions with the database at scale. Unfortunately, gRPC does not support browser-based client development.

The v3 client uses gRPC to connect to your Weaviate instance. The client supports Node.js, server-based development. It does not support browser-based web client development.


In the next sections we'll look at how to build client-server applications with..
- [Using backend web frameworks](./20_building-client-server.mdx)
- [Using fullstack web frameworks](./30_fullstack.mdx)



### <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Best Practices

As mentioned, it is recommended to use these,

As you build applications it is important to think about the following 
- Your API Tokens and where in your architecture they live
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) correctly
