## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Install Node.js

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Is Node.js installed?

Open a terminal window (e.g. bash, zsh, Windows PowerShell, Windows Terminal), and run:

```shell
node --version # or node -v
```

If you have Node.js installed, you should see a response like `v22.3.0`. The minimum version of Node.js supported by the Weaviate Typescript/Javascript library is `v18`. 


### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Install Node.js

To install, follow the instructions for your system on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Once you have Node.js installed, check the version again to confirm that you have a recommended version installed.

:::tip Advanced option: `nvm`
Another good way to install Python is to install `nvm`. This will allow you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system. You can find instructions on how to install `nvm` [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> (Optional) Set up Typescript

To install, follow the instructions for your system on [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/). Once installed, you can find instruction on how to configure Typescript to work with the Weaviate client documented [here](../../weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3.mdx#typescript-setup).

Now Typescript is ready to use with the Weaviate client.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Install the Weaviate client

Now, you can install the [Weaviate client library](../../weaviate/client-libraries/index.md), which will make it much easier to interact with Weaviate using Typescript.

In a new folder for your project, install the Weaviate client with:

```shell
npm install weaviate-client
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Confirm the installation

To confirm that the Weaviate client is installed, run the following in your terminal:

```shell
npm view weaviate-client
```

You should see an output like:

```text
3.1.4.
```

Congratulations, you are now set up to use Weaviate with the Weaviate TypeScript/JavaScript client library!
