This approach involves having two separate tools. One to build your server application; ideally a backend framework and another to build your client application. For this example, we will be using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) to build a backend server, and [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) to act as a client and make API calls to our backend server.

The server will have a single route that accepts a `searchTerm` as a query parameter. 

### 1. Initialize a Node.js application

We will use Express to build our server, in a new directory, run the following command to initialize a new project with Node.js

```bash 
npm init
```
### 2. Install project dependencies

With our project initialized, install `dotenv` to manage environment variables, `express` to build our server and the `weaviate-client` to manage communication with our Weaviate database. 

```bash
npm install express dotenv weaviate-client
```


### 3. Setup your Weaviate database

We'll start by creating a free sandbox account on [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/). Follow [this guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/manage-clusters/connect) if you have trouble setting up a sandbox project. 


You will need your Weaviate cluster URL and API key. If you don't already have one, create a new Cohere [API key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys), we use Cohere as our [embedding model](../using-ml-models/10_embedding.mdx). When done, add all three to your `.env` file.


 <TabItem value="js" label=".env">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START .env"
      endMarker="// END .env"
      language="js"
    />
  </TabItem>

#### 3.5 Add data to Weaviate

Follow our recipe on [loading data](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes-ts/blob/main/similarity-search/cohere/load.ts) into Weaviate to import data to your Weaviate database. 

### 4. Connecting to Weaviate 

In `config/weaviate.js`, paste the following code. 

 <TabItem value="js" label="weaviate.js">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START weaviate.js"
      endMarker="// END weaviate.js"
      language="js"
    />
  </TabItem>

The code above helps us create a connection to our Weaviate instance hosted on Weaviate Cloud.

### 5. Create a Search route

In your project root, create a file called `app.js` and paste the following code in it. 

 <TabItem value="js" label="app.js">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START app.js"
      endMarker="// END app.js"
      language="js"
    />
  </TabItem>

With this we can run searches on the `/search` route. We use `nearText()` to run our semantic search. 

#### 6. Run your server 
In your terminal run the following command to start your server.

```bash
node app.js
```

Your server should be running on `localhost:3005`. 



## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Building a client Application

With our server built, we can now make a call from a client application. We'll create a basic client application with HTML and JavaScript.

Alternatively, in [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/), you can make a call to `http://localhost:3005/search?searchTerm=countries in asia` to query your server.


### 1. Create a client application

In your root folder, create a file called `index.html` and paste the following code in it.

<TabItem value="html" label="index.html">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={ClientCode}
      startMarker="<!-- client start -->"
      endMarker="<!-- client stop -->"
      language="html"
    />
  </TabItem>


### 2. Run your client application 

In your root folder, run the following in your terminal

```bash
npx http-server
```


This client application makes a call to the express server you built, displaying results.
