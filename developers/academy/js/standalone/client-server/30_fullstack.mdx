title: Using Fullstack Web frameworks

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import FilteredTextBlock from '@site/src/components/Documentation/FilteredTextBlock';

import TSCode from '!!raw-loader!./_snippets/20_backend.js';

This approach involves having a single tool to build both your server application and client application. In modern web development terms, such a tool is called a fullstack web framework. For this example, we will be using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Building with Next.js

### 1. Create a Next.js application

To create a new application with Next.js, run the following command in your terminal. 

```bash
create-next-app <project-name> –ts –app
```
### 2. Install project dependencies

With our project initialized, install the `weaviate-client` to manage communication with our Weaviate database. 

```bash
npm install weaviate-client 
```

### 3. Setup your Weaviate database
We'll start by creating a free sandbox account on [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/). Follow [this guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/manage-clusters/connect) if you have trouble setting up a sandbox project. 


You will need your Weaviate cluster URL and API key. If you don't already have one, create a new Cohere [API key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys), we use Cohere as our [embedding model](../using-ml-models/10_embedding.mdx). When done, add all three to your `.env` file.

 <TabItem value="js" label=".env">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={TSCode}
      startMarker="// START .env"
      endMarker="// END .env"
      language="js"
    />
  </TabItem>

#### 3.5 Add data to Weaviate

Follow our recipe on [loading data](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes-ts/blob/main/similarity-search/cohere/load.ts) into Weaviate to import data to your Weaviate database. 

### 4. Initialize Weaviate 

Create a file in `utils/weaviate.ts` and paste the following code in it. The code helps us create a connection to our Weaviate instance hosted on Weaviate Cloud.


```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(process.env.WEAVIATE_URL as string,{
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey(process.env.WEAVIATE_API_KEY as string),
    headers: {
      'X-Cohere-Api-Key': process.env.COHERE_API_KEY as string
    }
  },
);
```

### 4. Create a Search Server Action 

Next, in `./utils/action.ts`, paste the following code. With this we can run semantic searches with `nearText()` by calling the function `vectorSearch()` in other parts of our application. 


```ts
"use server";

import { connectToDB } from './weaviate.ts'

export async function vectorSearch(searchTerm: string) {
  
  const myCollection = client.collections.get('MyCollectionName');

  const response = await myCollection.query.nearText(searchTerm, {
      limit: 8,
      returnMetadata: ['distance'],
    })

  return response
  }
```

### 5. Fetch data from your server in your client application. 
In the `./app` folder, paste the following code in `page.tsx`. We run a search on our client and display the results on the webpage. 

```tsx

import { vectorSearch } from '@/utils/action.ts';

export default async function Home() {
  const search = "water sports i can win a medal in"
  const data = await vectorSearch(search);

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <h1>
          { data }
          </h1>
        </body>
    </html>
  )

}
      
```
#### 6. Run your Fullstack App 

In your terminal, run the following command to start your application.


```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should be running on `localhost:3000`.

Although only detailing Next.js in guide, you can build with Weaviate using a number of fullstack frameworks including but not limited to [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.dev/)

We have a list of [starter](https://github.com/topics/weaviate-starter) applications you can play around with as well.
