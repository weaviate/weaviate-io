# Using Machine Learning Models in Weaviate

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-user"></i> Overview

Weaviate leverages two fundamental types of machine learning models to power AI-native applications:

1. **Embedding Models** - Transform data into high-dimensional vector representations
2. **Generative Models** - Create new content based on input prompts and context

This guide will help you understand how these models can be set up in Weaviate, briefly covering the functioning of these models on a high level as well. 

We will look at how to use the search enabled by the two types of embedding models supported in Weaviate; Text embeddings and Multimodal embeddings. 

This guide will also explore practical applications ranging from semantic search to complex AI agents.



**Next Steps:**

- Learn about [Generative Models](./20_generative.mdx)
- Check out our [Example Applications](./examples)
