These different search types are offered because they each have different characteristics, and therefore different strengths.

Let's explore the relative strengths of each search type.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> What are generative models

Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can take raw data — say, all of Wikipedia or the collected works of Rembrandt — and “learn” to generate statistically probable outputs when prompted. At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data and draw from it to create a new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.

Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Storing models in Weaviate

Weaviate is configured to support many different vectorizer models and vectorizer service providers. You can even bring your own vectors, for example if you already have a vectorization pipeline available, or if none of the publicly available models are suitable for you.

In Weaviate, generative models power our generative search.
