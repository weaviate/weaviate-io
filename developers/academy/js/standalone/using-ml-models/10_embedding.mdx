### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> What are embedding models

Embedding models are machine learning models trained to represent information as an array of numbers, frequently referred to as vector embeddings. Vectors or vector embeddings are numeric representations of data that represent certain properties or features. This representation can be used to efficiently search through objects in a vector space. 


Embeddings are the worker horses behind modern search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Storing models in Weaviate

Weaviate is configured to support many different vectorizer models and vectorizer service providers. You can even bring your own vectors, for example if you already have a vectorization pipeline available, or if none of the publicly available models are suitable for you.


### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Using embeddings

In Weaviate, vector embeddings power hybrid and semantic search.
