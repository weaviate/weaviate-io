The want stack is collection of technologies that simplify the process of build AI Native Applications.


#### Weaviate

Weaviate is a vector database, it gives you these benefits 
- vector search
- dynamic generative model selection (you don't get stuck)

#### AI 

- this ties heavily into everything else, AI is at the center of AI native, leveraging the flexibility of weaviate and teh vastness of its integrations, you can bring AI to your application from embeddings, to generative models to rerankers or recommenders. Without any tie in. The goal is to give you the most flexibility without the burden on choosing

#### Next.js (or Nuxt.js)

This brings modern web development, 


#### Typescript

Typescript.. add content
