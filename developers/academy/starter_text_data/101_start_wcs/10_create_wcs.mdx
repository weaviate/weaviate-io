title: Create a cloud Weaviate instance
---

For this course, we'll create a Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) instance. WCS is a fully managed Weaviate instance that runs in the cloud. It's a great way to get started with Weaviate, as it requires no installation or maintenance.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Log in to the WCS Console

Go to the [WCS Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and log in with your credentials. If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up by clicking on the <kbd>Register here</kbd> link from the login screen.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Create a Weaviate instance

From the console, go to the Dashboard and click on the <kbd>Create cluster</kbd> button. From the following screen:

- Select the "Free sandbox" tab
- Provide a cluster name
- Set "Enable authentication" to "Yes"

Click on the <kbd>Create</kbd> button to create your Weaviate instance. The process will take a few minutes.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Retrieve your Weaviate instance details

Once the instance is created, you will be able see its details by clicking on the <kbd>Details</kbd> button. Find the cluster URL and the API key.

You will need these details to connect to your Weaviate instance.
