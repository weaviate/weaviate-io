To run the `nearVector` query, you need to provide the full vector. You can view and copy the full vector below.

```python

# Shortened for clarity

meerkat_vector = [-0.024790961,  -0.01860295, ..., -0.008665809,-0.02698336]

```

This is the query.

```python
response = client.query.get(
    "JeopardyQuestion",
    ["question", "answer"]
).with_limit(2).with_near_vector(
    {"vector": meerkat_vector}
).with_additional(
    ["distance", "id"]
).do()

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

To run the `nearVector` query, first replace <MEERKAT_VECTOR> with the full vector. You can view and copy the full vector below.

      nearVector: {
        vector: <MEERKAT_VECTOR>
