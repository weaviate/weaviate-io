title: Run Weaviate on Kubernetes
---

Now that you have a Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy Weaviate on it. This section will show you how to deploy Weaviate on Kubernetes using Helm.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Helm chart

As mentioned earlier, **Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes. It uses a packaging format called **charts**.

A **Helm chart** is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources. It is the equivalent of a **package** in other package managers, such as pip or npm.

Weaviate provides a [Helm chart](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-helm) that you can use to deploy Weaviate on Kubernetes. So, we will use this Helm chart to deploy Weaviate on your Kubernetes cluster.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Deployment

First, add the [Weaviate Helm repository](https://weaviate.github.io/weaviate-helm) to your Helm installation. This will make the Weaviate Helm chart available to you.

```bash
helm repo add weaviate https://weaviate.github.io/weaviate-helm
```

:::tip Tip: Update the Helm repositories

If you have previously added the `weaviate` Helm repository, run this to update it to the latest version.

```bash
helm repo update weaviate
```

You should periodically [update the Helm repositories](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo_update/) to ensure that you have the latest information about available charts.

:::

Next, generate a configuration file (`values.yaml`) for the Weaviate Helm chart.

```bash
helm show values weaviate/weaviate > values.yaml
```

This command fetches the default values for the Weaviate Helm chart and saves them to a file named `values.yaml`. You can now edit this file to customize the deployment configuration.

There are many settings you can configure here. It may be beneficial to explore them in the `values.yaml` file, and review the relevant settings through the in-line comments, or in the [official Weaviate documentation](/developers/weaviate/index.md) if you are curious.

For now, let's configure a couple of important settings, before deploying Weaviate.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Configuration

Before we go further, let's update the configuration file to:

- Enable the gRPC service
- Enable Cohere integrations

Open the `values.yaml` file in a text editor, and update the following sections:

#### Enable the gRPC service

:::info Default settings
From helm chart version `17.0.0`, the gRPC service is enabled by default. If using older versions, you must enable it to use gRPC.
:::

Check that the service's `enabled` field is set to `true` and the `type` field is set to `LoadBalancer`. This will expose the gRPC service, which will allow you to access it from outside the Kubernetes cluster so you can make of the [gRPC API](/blog/grpc-performance-improvements).

```yaml
grpcService:
  enabled: true  # ⬅️ Make sure this is set to true
  name: weaviate-grpc
  ports:
    - name: grpc
      protocol: TCP
      port: 50051
  type: LoadBalancer  # ⬅️ Set this to LoadBalancer (from NodePort) for this example
```

#### Enable Cohere integrations

```yaml
  text2vec-cohere:

    enabled: true  # ⬅️ Make sure this is set to true

  # ... settings not shown ...
  generative-cohere:

    enabled: true  # ⬅️ Make sure this is set to true
```

Save the file after making these changes. You are now ready to deploy Weaviate on your Kubernetes cluster.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Run Weaviate

Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running (e.g. with `minikube start`), and you have configured `kubectl` to access it.

Let's first create a namespace for Weaviate:

```bash
kubectl create namespace weaviate
```

This will let us deploy Weaviate in a [separate namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces). This is not mandatory, but we will do it here as it is good practice to allow better organization of resources.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade --install \
  "weaviate" \
  weaviate/weaviate \
  --namespace "weaviate" \
  --values ./values.yaml
```

This command will deploy Weaviate in the `weaviate` namespace of your Kubernetes cluster using the configuration specified in the `values.yaml` file.

Now, if you run this:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n weaviate
```

You should see the Weaviate pods running in the `weaviate` namespace.

Note that it may take a little bit of time for the pods to start up. You can check the status of the pods by running the `kubectl get pods -n weaviate` command multiple times.

```bash
❯ kubectl get pods -n weaviate
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weaviate-0   0/1     Pending   0          15s

❯ kubectl get pods -n weaviate
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weaviate-0   1/1     Running   0          59s
```

Note how here, the `weaviate-0` pod went from `Pending` to `Running`.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed Weaviate on your local Kubernetes cluster. Next, let's confirm some basic interactions with Weaviate.

:::tip Upgrading to `1.25` or higher

To upgrade to `1.25` or higher from a pre-`1.25` version, you must delete the deployed `StatefulSet`, update the helm chart to version `17.0.0` or higher, and re-deploy Weaviate.

See the [1.25 migration guide for Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/more-resources/migration/weaviate-1-25) for more details.
