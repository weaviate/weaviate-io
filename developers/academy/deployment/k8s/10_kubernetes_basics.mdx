title: Create a Kubernetes cluster
---

**Kubernetes** is an open-source *container orchestration* platform. It means that you can use Kubernetes to deploy, scale, and manage [containerized](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) applications.

In production, Kubernetes is used to manage a cluster of nodes, such as those located on cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or on your own on-premises infrastructure.

Here, you learn how to do this using **Minikube**, a handy tool that allows you to run a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need the following tools:

- **Minikube**: a tool that runs a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine. It is used to test Kubernetes deployments locally.
- **kubectl**: the Kubernetes command-line tool. It is used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Docker**: a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. We will use Docker as the Minikube [*driver*](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/) to virtualize the Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
- **Helm**: a package manager for Kubernetes. It is used to install and manage applications on Kubernetes.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Installation

If you don't have any of these tools installed, you can follow the installation instructions for each, by following the links below:

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

Once you've done so, confirm installation by running the following commands:

```bash
minikube version
kubectl version --client
docker --version
helm version
```

You should see an output like:

```bash
minikube version: v1.32.0
commit: 8220a6eb95f0a4d75f7f2d7b14cef975f050512d
Client Version: v1.28.2
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.12.2", GitCommit:"1e210a2c8cc5117d1055bfaa5d40f51bbc2e345e", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.20.6"}
```

If you see similar output, you are ready to proceed.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Run Minikube

You are now ready to start Minikube. Run the following command:

```bash
minikube start
```

Then, you might see an output like this:

```bash

```

Great! You have started a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Note the last comment that says `kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default`. So, you can now use `kubectl` to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Verify the cluster

If you run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

This will show you the pods running in the cluster. You should see something like this:

```bash
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   coredns-5dd5756b68-qhfch           1/1     Running   0          26s
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0          42s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0          40s
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0          42s
kube-system   kube-proxy-xwdgf                   1/1     Running   0          26s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0          40s
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   0          39s
```

If your output is similar to the one above, then congratulations! You have successfully spun up a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine using Minikube.

Next, you will learn how to deploy Weaviate to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
