title: Access & Configure Weaviate
---

We have now spun up a Weaviate instance in our Kubernetes cluster. Let's access it.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Access Weaviate

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Expose the services

Since our Kubernetes configuration specifies:

```yaml
service:
  name: weaviate
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
type: LoadBalancer
```

Let's navigate to `http://localhost:80` in our browser. But this will sadly not work.

The reason is that we have not exposed the service to the outside world. With Minikube, we can do this by running:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

This command will expose the service to the outside world. You will see a message like:

```bash
✅  Tunnel successfully started

📌  NOTE: Please do not close this terminal as this process must stay alive for the tunnel to be accessible ...

❗  The service/ingress weaviate requires privileged ports to be exposed: [80]
🔑  sudo permission will be asked for it.
🏃  Starting tunnel for service weaviate.
🏃  Starting tunnel for service weaviate-grpc.
```

At this point you will be asked for your password. Enter it and the tunnel will be established.

:::info About `minikube tunnel`
[`minikube tunnel`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#using-minikube-tunnel) creates a route between your local machine and the Minikube cluster. This allows services within your Minikube cluster that are exposed as LoadBalancer to be accessible on your local machine for development.

We suggest you only run the tunnel command when you need to access the service from your local machine. When you are done, you can stop the tunnel by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

Now, if you run:

```bash
kubectl get svc weaviate -n weaviate
```

You will see the external IP address of the service. For example:

```bash
NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
weaviate   LoadBalancer   10.110.44.231   127.0.0.1     80:31230/TCP   61m
```

Navigate to `http://<external-ip>:80/v1` in your browser. You should see the Weaviate REST root endpoint, with links to the various endpoints available in Weaviate.

Now, you might also recall that we've opened up the gRPC service in our Kubernetes configuration. This service is available on port 50051. You can confirm this by running:

```bash
kubectl get svc weaviate-grpc -n weaviate
```

Which will show:

```bash
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
weaviate-grpc   LoadBalancer   10.109.237.21   127.0.0.1     50051:32150/TCP   90m
```

If you have netcat installed, you can also try:

```bach
nc -zv 127.0.0.1 50051
```

Which will show:

```bash
Connection to 127.0.0.1 port 50051 [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i> Configure Weaviate

One of the best things about Kubernetes is that you can easily configure your services. Weaviate is no exception. You can configure Weaviate by updating the `values.yaml` file in the `weaviate` directory.

For example, you can enable additional modules such as `text2vec-openai` and `generative-openai` modules by setting them to `true`:

```yaml
  text2vec-openai:

    enabled: true  # ⬅️ Set to true

  # ... other settings not shown ...

  generative-openai:

    enabled: true  # ⬅️ Set to true
```

Or we can set resource limits for the Weaviate pods. Let's set them to utilize 30-50% of a CPU, and 150-300Mi of memory:

:::note Where to set resource limits
The `values.yaml` file contains multiple instances of `requests` and `limits` for different services, such as for local vectorization models. Make sure to set the `requests` and `limits` for the scale replicas of Weaviate towards the top of the file with no indentation.
:::

```yaml
# Scale replicas of Weaviate. ...
requests:
  cpu: '300m'
  memory: '150Mi'
limits:
  cpu: '500m'
  memory: '300Mi'
```

To apply these changes, save the `values.yaml` file and run:

```bash
helm upgrade --install \
  "weaviate" \
  weaviate/weaviate \
  --namespace "weaviate" \
  --values ./values.yaml
```

You will note that this is the same command we used to deploy Weaviate. This command will simply update the Weaviate deployment with the new configuration.

There are a whole host of other configurations you can set in the `values.yaml` file, such as modifying authentication, authorization, backups, monitoring, resource allocation and so on. Please refer to the in-line documentation in the `values.yaml` file, and the Weaviate documentation for more information.

Before we go, however, let's take a look at expanding our Weaviate deployment to include more nodes. This can help us to scale our Weaviate deployment to handle more traffic or growth, or to provide redundancy in case of node failure.

We'll take a look at both in the next section.
