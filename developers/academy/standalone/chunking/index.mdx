So far, we've dealt with relatively short texts such as trivia quizzes as our source data. However, in the real world, texts can be very long - think about lengths of articles, transcripts, or even books. Long texts are typically not suitable as direct inputs for modern, transformer-based language models, whether they be vectorizer models or generative, large language models. This is because they can only handle finite lengths of text as inputs.

To deal with this limitation, a technique called chunking is often used. Like the name suggests, chunking splits longer bodies of text into smaller portions that can be handled by the model. However, there are many ways to chunk a text, and the choice of chunking strategy can have a significant impact on the performance of your model.

This unit covers this seemingly simple, but nuanced topic from the perspective of a user. We'll begin by covering what chunking is, and why it has become necessary, even though the existence of long texts is certainly not new.

We'll then move on to cover various chunking methods before discussing key considerations when deciding on a chunking strategy, as well as some suggested starting points.

By the end of this unit, you will have a good understanding of chunking in general, and be able to implement some solid chunking strategies based on your actual needs.
