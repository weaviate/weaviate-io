## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview

We have covered a lot of ground on chunking in this unit already.

You saw what chunking is and learned about different chunking methods, and dived into example implementations so that you can see their impact.

In this section, we will take a step back out from the detailed, micro view to the high level, macro view, while using all that we've learned in context. More specifically, we will take a look at some considerations of what to think about when chunking data, and what it means for your Weaviate implementation.
