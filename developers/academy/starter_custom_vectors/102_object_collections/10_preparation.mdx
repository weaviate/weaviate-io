In this section you are going to populate your Weaviate instance with a movie dataset and corresponding vectors which are generated outside of Weaviate.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Weaviate instance

Make sure to have your Weaviate instance set up. You should have [created an instance](../101_setup_weaviate/20_create_instance/index.mdx) and be able to connect to it.

<!-- TODO: Add notes for users looking to use another vectorizer -->

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Source data

We are going to use a movie dataset sourced from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The dataset can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/edu-datasets/main/movies_data_1990_2024.json), and it contains bibliographic information on ~700 movies released between 1990 and 2024.
