In this project-based course, you'll learn how to work with any text data using Weaviate.

Through the example of a movie dataset, you'll learn how to store and index text data by meaning. You'll learn how Weaviate's built-in vectorizers abstract this process, as well as semantic searches

You'll also learn about different types of searches, and retrieval augmented generation that can greatly enhance AI models.
