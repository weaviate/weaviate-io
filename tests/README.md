## Code example tests

We are working on making as much of the site's code examples testable, so that they are robust to edits and remain up-to-date.


### Set-up

#### Python virtual environment

The tests are built around Python and the `pytest` library. Go to the root directory of the repo, and create a virtual environment by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment ()
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
```

#### Install Node

Additionally, [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for running the JavaScript / TypeScript tests, as well as Docusaurus itself locally.

After installing Node, run `yarn` to install the project dependencies.

#### Golang

Install `go` and set up your Go workspace.

The testable `go` code examples are in the `/_includes/code/howto/go/` directory.

Each file in this directory is a self-contained, testable Go code example. Review existing code examples for the patterns to follow.

Mark the start and end of the code snippet to display in the documentation with comments such as `// START <SnippetName>` and `// END <SnippetName>`. Then, use these markers to filter the code snippet in the documentation using the `FilteredTextBlock` component.

### 💻 Run tests

Then, from the repo root directory, run `pytest` from the shell. This will initialize all tests.

#### Test markers

Tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.<marker>`, for example:

`pyv4`: Tests Python snippets that use the v4 client library.
`pyv3`: Tests Python snippets that use the v3 client library.
`ts`: Tests JavaScript/TypeScript snippets in scripts.
`java`: Tests Java snippets in scripts.
`go`: Tests Go snippets in scripts.

You can run tests for a specific marker by running `pytest -m <marker>`, for example `pytest -m pyv4` to run only tests for Python API v4 snippets.

#### Test configuration

The tests and related files are located in `./tests`.
Before tests are run, `pytest` is configured to run `start-weaviate.sh` to spin up multiple instances of Weaviate (e.g. per `docker-compose.yml`).

Thus, tests can be run against a permanent WCD instance, or one of these ephemeral instances. Check the individual Docker Compose files for the ports that are used for each instance.

#### (Optional) ☕️ Run TypeScript tests separately

As we're migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, examples are gradually being migrated into `_includes/code/*` directories. You can already see there tests for the [Search howtos](/developers/weaviate/search). The `_includes/code/` directory contains a local `package.json` file for the code samples, which sets the "type" to "module" to enable `import` statements.

To run tests for the TypeScript examples, execute `npm test` in the `_includes/code/` directory. (You may have to replace sample API keys and host URLs like `YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY` or `WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL` in files that don't use environment variables.)
