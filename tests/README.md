## Code example tests

We are working on making as much of the site's code examples testable, so that they are robust to edits and remain up-to-date.


### Set-up

#### Python virtual environment

The tests are built around Python and the `pytest` library. Go to the root directory of the repo, and create a virtual environment by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment ()
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
```

#### Install Node

Additionally, [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for running the JavaScript / TypeScript tests, as well as Docusaurus itself locally.

After installing Node, run `yarn` to install the project dependencies.


### üíª Run tests

Then, from the repo root directory, run `pytest` from the shell. This will initialize all tests.

#### Test markers

Tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.<marker>`, for example:

`pyv4`: Tests Python snippets that use the v4 client library.
`pyv3`: Tests Python snippets that use the v3 client library.
`ts`: Tests JavaScript/TypeScript snippets in scripts.
`java`: Tests Java snippets in scripts.
`go`: Tests Go snippets in scripts.

You can run tests for a specific marker by running `pytest -m <marker>`, for example `pytest -m pyv4` to run only tests for Python API v4 snippets.

#### Test configuration

The tests and related files are located in `./tests`.
Before tests are run, `pytest` is configured to run `start-weaviate.sh` to spin up multiple instances of Weaviate (e.g. per `docker-compose.yml`).

Thus, tests can be run against a permanent WCD instance, or one of these ephemeral instances. Check the individual Docker Compose files for the ports that are used for each instance.

#### (Optional) ‚òïÔ∏è Run TypeScript tests separately

As we're migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, examples are gradually being migrated into `_includes/code/*` directories. You can already see there tests for the [Search howtos](/developers/weaviate/search). The `_includes/code/` directory contains a local `package.json` file for the code samples, which sets the "type" to "module" to enable `import` statements.

To run tests for the TypeScript examples, execute `npm test` in the `_includes/code/` directory. (You may have to replace sample API keys and host URLs like `YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY` or `WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL` in files that don't use environment variables.)
