We’re excited to announce that our Weaviate Enterprise Cloud product is now ready to store electronic Patient Health Data in AWS. As of June 26, you can securely store, index, and search Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI) in Weaviate—fully in line with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Our platform now includes advanced encryption (in transit and at rest), role-based access controls, immutable backups, and lifecycle-managed storage, all backed by signed Business Associate Agreements (BAAs).

Why does this matter? Healthcare organizations process enormous volumes of sensitive data—and they spend billions of dollars each year on inefficient workflows and manual processes. Weaviate empowers doctors, insurers, and care teams to eliminate waste, accelerate claims processing, and deliver more data-driven decisions. Now, you can build HIPAA-ready AI applications on Weaviate with confidence, knowing your patients’ privacy and your compliance obligations are fully protected.

## Weaviate’s Compliance Journey

### Proven Security Foundations: GDPR, SOC II, ISO & Beyond

Weaviate’s commitment to data protection is built on a robust framework of industry-leading certifications and audits. For over 18 months, we’ve maintained SOC II compliance, integrating comprehensive GDPR controls to secure European and global data. Earlier this year, we completed our Phase 1 audit for ISO 27001:2022, with full accreditation expected by July. Now, we are expanding our certification portfolio by adding HIPAA compliance, which will be incorporated into our next SOC II audit at year-end.

Beyond these core standards, our Business Continuity Management System aligns with ISO 22301:2019, with full certification planned for 2026\. Together, these milestones demonstrate Weaviate’s readiness to meet the highest regulatory requirements, ensuring your data remains secure, resilient, and compliant across every market.

### Advanced Security Controls for HIPAA Compliance

Weaviate Enterprise Cloud on AWS now includes a suite of purpose-built safeguards that meet HIPAA’s technical requirements and ensure your PHI remains protected at every layer:

* **End-to-End Encryption:** All data is encrypted in transit (TLS/mTLS) and at rest (AES-256), including internal Kubernetes traffic. This guarantees that ePHI cannot be intercepted or exposed at any point in your environment.  
* **Customer-Managed Keys:** Maintain full control over your encryption keys for data-at-rest protection. You can supply your own keys via AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to enforce strict separation of duties.  
* **Granular Access Controls & Auditing:** Role-based access ensures only authorized users and services can query or modify PHI. Detailed audit logs capture every read, write, and administrative action for complete visibility.  
* **Immutable, Redundant Backups:** Daily snapshots are stored in immutable, zonally redundant storage to prevent tampering and guarantee rapid recovery during a disaster.

These controls work together to provide a turnkey, HIPAA-ready environment for all your healthcare workloads.

### Future HIPAA Support: Azure, GCP & Serverless

Weaviate’s HIPAA compliance is not limited to AWS. Based on customer demand, we’ll soon extend these safeguards to other environments:

* **Azure:** Full HIPAA-ready deployment for Weaviate Enterprise Cloud on Azure is arriving in the next few months.  
* **Weaviate Serverless Cloud:** We’re enabling serverless workloads to meet HIPAA standards, giving you elastic scalability with enterprise-grade security.  
* **GCP:** Support for Google Cloud Platform is on our roadmap, ensuring you can run compliant vector search across all major clouds.

Stay tuned for detailed announcements and availability dates as we roll out these enhancements.

## Example Real-world Use Cases

Weaviate enables healthcare providers, insurance companies and practices to semantically search data and retrieve important contextually relevant insights quickly. Below are five examples of this in practice.

### Faster Claims Processing

**Insurance claimants need their claim turned around quickly and accurately**. By storing and vectorizing claims data in Weaviate, a connected LLM can instantly pull together all relevant patient history, diagnoses, and treatment notes, then deliver a concise, contextual summary to claim handlers. This reduces manual review time and accelerates approvals, helping payers save both time and money.

### Remote Patient Monitoring & Alerting

**Continuous streams of wearable or home-monitoring data (heart rate, glucose, etc.) can overwhelm traditional rule-based systems and miss subtle warning signs.** By streaming sensor feeds into Weaviate alongside patients’ clinical records, you can define semantic alerts, such as *“find glucose readings \>180 mg/dL correlated with rapid heart-rate spikes”*, so that care teams receive precise, real-time notifications, all within an end-to-end encrypted and immutable-log environment.

### Personalized Patient Appointments

**It is difficult for doctors to understand a patient’s full medical history—prior visits, prescribed medications, lab results—when they arrive for their appointment**. Rather than combing through disparate systems, Weaviate can enable care teams to access an easy-to-read summary at the point of care, leading to more informed consultations and improved patient experience.

### Medical-Image Metadata Retrieval

**Radiology and pathology images often come with free-text captions and annotations stored separately, making it hard to find the right scans at scale.** By embedding both image metadata and transcribed notes into Weaviate, clinicians can simply ask *“show me all MRI scans of patients with suspected meningioma”* to retrieve exactly the right series—complete with HIPAA-compliant audit logs for every access request.

### Continuous Professional Development (CPD)

**Keeping medical staff up to date with new publications and journals is challenging and time-consuming.** Especially while ensuring they don’t miss critical retractions or updates. With medical journals and training material uploaded as unstructured text into Weaviate. Healthcare professionals can receive weekly “CPD roundups” that filter for the most relevant new research, automatically summarize key findings, and flag any withdrawn or contested articles.

Even in this high-level overview, you can see how HIPAA-compliant vector search on Weaviate unlocks major efficiency gains—without sacrificing privacy.
