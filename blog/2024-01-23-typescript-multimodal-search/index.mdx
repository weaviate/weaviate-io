![Cover, Building Multimodal AI in TypeScript](./img/hero.png)


For a lot of people, Multimodal AI and its derivatives are strong contenders for technology of the year. The promises of Multimodal applications of artificial intelligence are exciting and speak to behavioural changes in media consumption and general interaction with the internet. I'm here to show you how you can get a piece of the pie. In this article, we’ll look at how to build Multimodal applications in Typescript and dive into everything that needs to happen in between.



## Modalities 
> A modality is a particular mode in which something exists or is experienced or expressed.

### Single Modality 

Historically, search has been over text, emphasizing the relevance of [keyword search](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/bm25). This type of search was focused on matching text search terms to large datasets of text and returning the most relevant. This was the single modality; text search through data and get back text.

Even with the onset of multimedia; images, videos and audio. We leveraged metadata and attached text to these more complex modalities and essentially ran keyword searches. Still a single-modality search. 

Early versions of large language models followed suit. With most being single modality models, with a single model inference.

### Multi-Modality

In today's world, not only are people optimizing for TikTok searches but the video hosting service is the search engine of choice for a [majority of Gen Z](https://www.campaignasia.com/article/tiktok-trumps-google-as-a-search-engine-research-finds/492905). Multimodality enables search queries with multiple media types over multiple media types. Enabling you to text search over datasets of video or mixed media. 

Mostly enabled by [vector](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/similarity) and [hybrid search](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid), Vector databases by design are uniquely adapted to storing, indexing and enabling efficient retrieval for multimodal use cases. On the machine learning model side of things, we’re seeing the rise of multimodal models that can infer numerous modalities. 

This means we can interact with an LLM via chat and have the LLMs generate text, audio or video. By definition, this would enable interaction with similar models via text or even video.

## Building our own Multimodal Search

Now that we have a better understanding of multi-modal search, let’s build a search application with [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Specwise, we want to be able to run a text search through image, video and audio data without leveraging the file's metadata. 


### Requirements

You need the following to go through with this tutorial. 

- An LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.9.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> The project that this tutorial is based on is [available on Github](https://github.com/malgamves/next-multimodal-search-demo) if you’d like to give it a try before going through with the tutorial. 


Create your Next.js application that comes with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and the App Router with the following command.

```bash
create-next-app <project-name> –ts –tailwind –app 
```

### Getting Weaviate Running
In the newly created folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file and paste the following code into it. 

```yml
version: '3.4'
services:
  weaviate:
    image: semitechnologies/weaviate:1.23.4
    restart: on-failure:0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
        QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
        AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'
        PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
        DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: 'multi2vec-bind'
        ENABLE_MODULES: 'multi2vec-bind'
        BIND_INFERENCE_API: 'http://multi2vec-bind:8080'
        CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'
  multi2vec-bind:
    image: semitechnologies/multi2vec-bind:imagebind
    environment:
      ENABLE_CUDA: '0'

```


Then run `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal to start an instance of Weaviate with [ImageBind](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/), our Multimodal model. This also enables us to use the [multi2vec-bind](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/multi2vec-bind) module, the tool that enables us to store vector embeddings of video, text, audio and image data. 

### Importing Data

Next, we will create a Weavaite collection and import data into it. In your `./public` folder, create three folders called *image*, *audio*, and *video*. These will store media corresponding to their folder names respectively. You can then add your data or [use the data I added](https://github.com/malgamves/next-multimodal-search-demo/tree/main/public) to build out the original application. 

We then install the Weaviate [TypeScript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-ts-client) and other project dependencies with the following command.
```bash
yarn add weaviate-ts-client use-debounce rimraf 
```

To import our data, we need to create a folder called `src` where our import scripts will go. 

To start, create a file called `client.ts` and paste the following code in it to initialize the Weaviate client. 

```typescript
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from 'weaviate-ts-client';

let client: WeaviateClient;

export const getWeaviateClient = () => {
  if (!client) {
    client = weaviate.client({
      scheme: 'http',
      host: 'localhost:8080',
    });
  };
  
  return client;
}

```


Next, still in `./src` we create a file called `util.ts` and paste the following code in it. 

```typescript
import {readdirSync, readFileSync, } from 'fs'

export interface FileInfo {
    name: string;
    path: string;
}

export const listFiles = (path: string): FileInfo[] => {
    return readdirSync(path).map((name) => {
        return {
            name: name,
            path: `${path}${name}`,
        }
    });
}

export const getBase64 = (file: string) => {
    return readFileSync(file, { encoding: 'base64' });
}

```

This file defines base64 as the encoding for the files we are importing and lists all the files in a directory.

We then create a file called `collection.ts`, where we define our Weaviate collection and its properties.

```typescript
import { WeaviateClient } from 'weaviate-ts-client';
import { getWeaviateClient } from './client';

const client: WeaviateClient = getWeaviateClient();

const collectionExists = async (name: string) => {
  return client.schema.exists(name);
}

export const createBindCollection = async (name: string) => {
  if(await collectionExists(name)) {
    console.log(`The collection [${name}] already exists. No need to create it.`);
    return;
  }
  
  console.log(`Creating collection [${name}].`);

  const bindSchema = {
    class: name,
    moduleConfig: {
      'multi2vec-bind': {
        imageFields: ['image'],
        audioFields: ['audio'],
        videoFields: ['video'],
      }
    },
    properties: [
      {
        name: 'name',
        dataType: ['text'],
        moduleConfig: {
          'multi2vec-bind': { skip: true },
        },
      },
      {
        name: 'media',
        dataType: ['text'],
        moduleConfig: {
          'multi2vec-bind': { skip: true },
        },
      },
      {
        name: 'image',
        dataType: ['blob'],
      },
      {
        name: 'audio',
        dataType: ['blob'],
      },
      {
        name: 'video',
        dataType: ['blob'],
      }
    ],
    vectorIndexType: 'hnsw',
    vectorizer: 'multi2vec-bind'
  }
  
  const res = await client
    .schema.classCreator()
    .withClass(bindSchema)
    .do();

}

export const deleteCollection = async (name: string) => {
  console.log(`Deleting collection ${name}...`);
  await client.schema
  .classDeleter()
  .withClassName(name)
  .do();

  console.log(`Deleted collection ${name}.`);
}

```

This file contains a function to create a collection, a function to delete a collection, and a function to check if a collection exists. If there are any details we want to change that would define our collections, we can do so in this file.

Notably, we create a new class and define media types of image, video and audio to our `multi2vec-bind` module. We also add the following properties to our collection: `media`, `name`, `image`, `audio`, and `video`. Think of these as properties we will be able to query against when we start to make queries or import data to Weavaite.



Now we create a file called `import.ts` that uses Weaviates `ObjectsBatcher` to batch import files.

```typescript
import { ObjectsBatcher, WeaviateClient, generateUuid5 } from 'weaviate-ts-client';
import { getWeaviateClient } from './client';
import { FileInfo, getBase64, listFiles } from './util';

const sourceBase = 'public';
const sourceImages = sourceBase + '/image/'
const sourceAudio = sourceBase + '/audio/';
const sourceVideo = sourceBase + '/video/';

const client: WeaviateClient = getWeaviateClient();

export const importMediaFiles = async (collectionName: string) => {
    await insertImages(collectionName);
    await insertAudio(collectionName);
    await insertVideo(collectionName);
}

const insertImages = async (collectionName: string) => {
    let batcher: ObjectsBatcher = client.batch.objectsBatcher();
    let counter = 0;
    const batchSize = 5;

    const files = listFiles(sourceImages);
    console.log(`Importing ${files.length} images.`)

    for (const file of files) {
        const item = {
            name: file.name,
            image: getBase64(file.path),
            media: 'image'
        };
        
        console.log(`Adding [${item.media}]: ${item.name}`);

        batcher = batcher.withObject({
            class: collectionName,
            properties: item,
            id: generateUuid5(file.name)
        });

        if (++counter == batchSize) {
            console.log(`Flushing ${counter} items.`)

            // flush the batch queue
            await batcher.do();
      
            // restart the batch queue
            counter = 0;
            batcher = client.batch.objectsBatcher();
        }
    }

    if (counter > 0) {
        console.log(`Flushing remaining ${counter} item(s).`)
        await batcher.do();
        
    }
}


const insertAudio = async (collectionName: string) => {
    let batcher: ObjectsBatcher = client.batch.objectsBatcher();
    let counter = 0;
    const batchSize = 3;

    const files = listFiles(sourceAudio);
    console.log(`Importing ${files.length} audio files.`)

    for (const file of files) {
        const item = {
            name: file.name,
            audio: getBase64(file.path),
            media: 'audio'
        };

        console.log(`Adding [${item.media}]: ${item.name}`);
        
        batcher = batcher.withObject({
            class: collectionName,
            properties: item,
            id: generateUuid5(file.name)
        });

        if (++counter == batchSize) {
            console.log(`Flushing ${counter} items.`)
            // flush the batch queue
            await batcher.do();
      
            // restart the batch queue
            counter = 0;
            batcher = client.batch.objectsBatcher();
        }
    }

    if (counter > 0) {
        console.log(`Flushing remaining ${counter} item(s).`)
        await batcher.do();
    }
}

const insertVideo = async (collectionName: string) => {
    let batcher: ObjectsBatcher = client.batch.objectsBatcher();
    let counter = 0;
    const batchSize = 1;

    const files = listFiles(sourceVideo);
    console.log(`Importing ${files.length} video files.`)

    for (const file of files) {
        const item = {
            name: file.name,
            video: getBase64(file.path),
            media: 'video'
        };

        console.log(`Adding [${item.media}]: ${item.name}`);
        
        batcher = batcher.withObject({
            class: collectionName,
            properties: item,
            id: generateUuid5(file.name)
        });

        if (++counter == batchSize) {
            console.log(`Flushing ${counter} items.`)
            // flush the batch queue
            await batcher.do();
      
            // restart the batch queue
            counter = 0;
            batcher = client.batch.objectsBatcher();
        }
    }

    if (counter > 0) {
        console.log(`Flushing remaining ${counter} item(s).`)
        await batcher.do();
    }
}

```

This file reads out images, video and audio directories for media and then encodes them before sending them to Weaviate to be stored.


We then create a file called `index.ts` where we run all the files we created above. 

```typescript
import { createBindCollection, deleteCollection } from './collection';
import { importMediaFiles } from './import';

const collectionName = 'BindExample';

const run = async () => {
  await deleteCollection(collectionName);
  await createBindCollection(collectionName);
  await importMediaFiles(collectionName);
}

run();

```

In `index.ts` we can change our collection name to our liking. When this file is run, we delete any existing collection that exists with the name we specify, create a new collection with the same name and then import all the media files in our `.public` folder.

> It's important to note that we need our Weaviate instance running with Docker before going to the next step. 


To run our import process, we need to add the following scripts to our `package.json` file.

```js
  …
"scripts": {
      …
    "preimport": "rimraf ./build && tsc src/*.ts --outDir build",
    "import": "npm run preimport && node build/index.js"
        …
  },
  …
```

We can now run `yarn run import` to start the import process. Depending on how much data you're importing, it can take a little time. While that runs, let's create our Search interface.

### Building Search Functionality

Now we need to create a couple of components that will go in our web application.

Create a `./components` folder and add a file called `search.tsx`. Paste the following code in it.

```typescript 
'use client'

import { useSearchParams, usePathname, useRouter } from "next/navigation"
import { useDebouncedCallback } from "use-debounce"

export default function Search({ placeholder }: { placeholder: string }) {
    const searchParams = useSearchParams()
    const pathname = usePathname()
    const { replace } = useRouter()

    const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term: string) => {
        const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
        if (term) {
            params.set("search", term)
        } else {
            params.delete("search")
        }
        replace(pathname + "?" + params)
    }, 300);
    return (
        <div className="pt-20">
            <div className="relative">
                <label htmlFor="search" className="sr-only"> Search </label>
                <input
                    type="search"
                    id="search"
                    placeholder={placeholder}
                    onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
                    defaultValue={searchParams.get("search")?.toString()}
                    className="w-[400px] h-12 rounded-md bg-gray-200 p-2 shadow-sm sm:text-sm"
                />
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

```

We have an input tag that takes search terms from users. We then pass these search terms to our URL params and then use the `replace` method from `next/navigation` to update the URL. This will update the URL and trigger a new search when the user stops typing.


Optionally, you can import the [footer](https://github.com/malgamves/next-multimodal-search-demo/blob/main/components/footer.tsx) and [navigation](https://github.com/malgamves/next-multimodal-search-demo/blob/main/components/navigation.tsx) components. We don’t really need them to demonstrate Multimodal search but they make the app look nicer! 


In the `./app` folder, paste the following code in `page.tsx`, 

```typescript
// import Footer from '@/components/footer';
// import Navigation from '@/components/navigation';
import Search from '../components/search'
import Link from 'next/link'

import weaviate, {
  WeaviateClient,
  WeaviateObject,
} from "weaviate-ts-client";

const client: WeaviateClient = weaviate.client({
  scheme: 'http',
  host: 'localhost:8080',
});


export default async function Home({
  searchParams
}: {
  searchParams?: {
    search?: string;
  }
}) {
  const search = searchParams?.search || "";
  const data = await searchDB(search);


  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <div className="fixed h-screen w-full bg-gradient-to-br from-lime-100 via-teal-50 to-amber-100" />
        
       {/* <Navigation />  */}

        <main className="flex min-h-screen w-full flex-col items-center justify-center py-32">

          <Search placeholder="Search for a word" />

          <div className="relative flex grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 lg:grid-cols-4 lg:gap-8 p-20">

            {data.map((result: WeaviateObject) => (
              <div key={result?._additional.id} className="">

                <div className="h-40 w-50">
                  <p className=" w-16 h-6 mt-2 ml-2 block text-center whitespace-nowrap items-center justify-center rounded-lg translate-y-8 transform  bg-white px-2.5 py-0.5 text-sm text-black">
                    {result.media}
                  </p>

                  {result?.media == 'image' &&
                    <img

                      alt="Certainty: "
                      className='block object-cover w-full h-full rounded-lg'
                      src={
                        '/' + result.media + '/' + result.name
                      }
                    />
                  }

                  {result?.media == 'audio' &&
                    <audio controls src={
                      '/' + result.media + '/' + result.name
                    } className='block object-none w-full h-full rounded-lg'>
                      Your browser does not support the audio element.
                    </audio>

                  }

                  {result.media == 'video' &&
                    <video controls src={
                      '/' + result.media + '/' + result.name
                    } className='block object-none w-full h-full rounded-lg'>
                      Your browser does not support the video element.
                    </video>

                  }

                </div>

              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </main>
         {/* <Footer /> */}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}


async function searchDB(search: string) {

  const res = await client.graphql
    .get()
    .withClassName("BindExample")
    .withFields("media name _additional{ certainty id }")
    .withNearText({ concepts: [`${search}`] })
    .withLimit(8)
    .do();

  return res.data.Get.BindExample;
}

```

Here we define a function `searchDB()`, which makes a call to Weaviate to search for the given search term. We then map the results to the UI. Weaviate lets us run a vector search from our `BindExample` collection with `withNearText()` and pass the user-entered search term as a query. We can define properties we want to search on with `withFields()` and the number of results we want to return with `withLimit()`. We then pass the query response to be displayed on the UI.


### Final Result
Then you should be able to search like this

## Conclusion

We just saw how to leverage a Multimodal AI model to power our Multimodal search in Typescript with Next.js. A lot is happening in the space and this only just scratches the surface of Multimodal use cases. One could take this a step further and enable search via image, video or audio uploads. Another avenue worth exploring is Generative Multimodal models to either enhance results or interact with existing datasets.
