![Weaviate Python Client v4 Release](./img/hero.png)

The `v4` Weaviate Python client library has landed in GA (general availability) form. The `v4` client has a brand new API that is more powerful and easier to use ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³. This is a big update, as reflected by the bump in the major version number.

It still includes the existing (`v3`) API for now, so you can continue to use it without any changes. But we do note and the `v3` API is considered deprecated, and will be removed in the future (estimated ~6 months).

If you're keen to get on with it, just `pip` install it with:

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

But if you're curious about what's new, read on - there's a lot that we are excited about!

## Key ideas

The `v4` client does things a little differently than the `v3` client. Two of the key ideas where it differs are:

- Collection-based interactions, and
- Default property returns to queries.

Take this query, for example:

<FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# START HybridQueryExample"
    endMarker="# END HybridQueryExample"
    language="py"
/>

Here, you'll notice that the query:
- is performed on a collection (`questions`), not the `client` itself, and
- does not specify any properties to return.

This is because the `v4` client is collection-based, and will return all properties (except `blob`s and references) by default. We think this makes the code more concise, and easier to use.

### IDE assistance / autocomplete

And writing the queries is now also much easier, with more IDE assistance and autocomplete. For example, here's a query that uses the `Filter` class:

![Weaviate Python Client v4 Release](./img/pyv4_ide_example2_filter.gif)

Notice all the nice autocomplete suggestions as we type! This extends to a great majority of operations, from collection creation to object insertion to query building.

### Speed improvements

The new client is much faster than the `v3` client, too. This is because it uses gRPC extensively under-the-hood.

The speed improvements during imports will increase along with the request size. As some rough examples, we've seen:

| Data imported | `v3` client | `v4` client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ann` dataset | ~50s | ~30s |
| 50k `sphere` objects | ~200s | ~120s |

Queries will also be faster with the `v4` client, with ~40% - ~80% speed improvements being seen in our internal testing.

These are just some rough examples, but we think many of you will see noticeable speed improvements across the board. Also keep an eye out for a follow-up blogpost on this topic, where we'll dive into the details ðŸ˜‰.

### Typing & type safety

Provision of these classes also means that the client is able to provide far more type hints, proving higher type safety.

For example, the `like` method in our `Filter` class example above helpfully tells you to insert the argument as a `str`. But if we were to use a `within_geo_range` method, it would tell us to use a coordinate as a `GeoCoordinate` instance, and a distance as a `float`.

This helps you to write the correct code, and also helps you to catch errors early.

## Practical examples

Here are some practical examples. You'll find plenty of them throughout the [Weaviate documentation](/developers/weaviate/) - here, we present a few commonly used operations, with notes as required.

### `v4` vs `v3` API

import CollectionsV4 from '!!raw-loader!/_includes/code/howto/manage-data.collections.py';
import CollectionsV3 from '!!raw-loader!/_includes/code/howto/manage-data.collections-v3.py';

Here is an example that really captures the difference between the `v4` and `v3` APIs. Look at the difference in the code required to create a collection with properties.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python (v4)">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={CollectionsV4}
      startMarker="# START CreateCollectionWithProperties"
      endMarker="# END CreateCollectionWithProperties"
      language="python"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py3" label="Python (v3)">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={CollectionsV3}
      startMarker="# START CreateCollectionWithProperties"
      endMarker="# END CreateCollectionWithProperties"
      language="python"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `v3` client API uses an untyped dictionary to specify the collection definition. It's efficient, but not very robust, and not particularly easy to use.

On the other hand, the `v4` client API provides plenty of help through type hints and autocomplete suggestions as you navigate to the `.create` method, and use classes such as `Property` and `DataType`. It's also more robust, and easier to use.

### Submodules

For discoverability, the classes that are used as arguments in function calls are arranged into submodules based on the type of operation they are used in.

<details>
  <summary>Submodule details</summary>

The structure is similar to the collections structure. For example, if you are performing a query (e.g. `collection.query.XXX`) you'll find the needed classes in general under `wvc.query.XXX`. The following table shows the submodules and their descriptions.

| Module                      | Description                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `weaviate.classes.config`   | Collection creation / modification  |
| `weaviate.classes.data`     | CUD operations                      |
| `weaviate.classes.query`    | query/search operations             |
| `weaviate.classes.aggregate`| aggregate operations                |
| `weaviate.classes.generic`  | generics                            |
| `weaviate.classes.init`     | initialization                      |
| `weaviate.classes.tenants`  | tenants                             |
| `weaviate.classes.batch`    | batch operations                    |

You can import the whole `classes` module, or just the classes you need. Many examples throughout the documentation use `import weaviate.classes as wvc` as a convention.

</details>

### Client instantiation

The `v4` client provide a set of helper functions, for connecting to Weaviate through its various deployment methods.

Direct instantiation with full control over the parameters is also possible, too. And, if you need an instance of the `v3` style client, you can still use it.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="wcs" label="WCS">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# WCSInstantiation"
            endMarker="# END WCSInstantiation"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="local" label="Local">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# LocalInstantiationBasic"
            endMarker="# END LocalInstantiationBasic"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="embedded" label="Embedded">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# EmbeddedInstantiationBasic"
            endMarker="# END EmbeddedInstantiationBasic"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="direct" label="Direct instantiation">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# DirectInstantiationFull"
            endMarker="# END DirectInstantiationFull"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="v3" label="V3 API">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# InstantiationV3API"
            endMarker="# END InstantiationV3API"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Just remember that with the new `WeaviateClient` instances (i.e. `v4` API), you should close the connection when you're done with it, as shown in the examples below. (This is still not necessary with the `v3` API.)

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="try" label="Try / Finally">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# TryFinallyExample"
            endMarker="# END TryFinallyExample"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="context" label="Context Manager">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# ClientContextManagerExample"
            endMarker="# END ClientContextManagerExample"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Batch operations

The new client provides a set of methods to configure batching. These methods help you to control the batching behavior - including a handy `rate_limit()` method to avoid going past any third-party API rate limits.

| Method | Description | When to use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `dynamic` | The batch size is dynamically calculated by Weaviate. | Recommended starting point. |
| `fixed_size` | The batch size is fixed to a size specified by a user. | When you want to control the batch size. |
| `rate_limit` | The number of objects sent to Weaviate is rate limited (specified as n_objects per minute). | When you want to avoid hitting third-party vectorization API rate limits. |

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="wcs" label="Dynamic">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BatchDynamic"
            endMarker="# END BatchDynamic"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="local" label="Fixed size">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BatchFixedSize"
            endMarker="# END BatchFixedSize"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="embedded" label="Rate limit">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BatchRateLimit"
            endMarker="# END BatchRateLimit"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Error handling in batch operations

The `v4` client introduces additional error handling operations. You can now monitor the number of errors in an ongoing batching operation, or simply review the errors after the operation has completed.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="progress" label="During batching">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BatchErrorMonitor"
            endMarker="# END BatchErrorMonitor"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="end" label="After completion">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BatchSimpleErrorHandling"
            endMarker="# END BatchSimpleErrorHandling"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Insertion methods

There's also single insertion methods, of course. And to that, we've added a `insert_many` method which is a convenience method for inserting a list of objects.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="batching" label="Batch">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BatchBasic"
            endMarker="# END BatchBasic"
            language="py"
        />
        <i>Generally recommended for any multi-object operations.</i>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="insert_many" label="Insert many">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START InsertManyBasic"
            endMarker="# END InsertManyBasic"
            language="py"
        />
        <i>If you just have a list of objects to insert.</i>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="insert" label="Single insert">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START CreateObjectExample"
            endMarker="# END CreateObjectExample"
            language="py"
        />
        <i>For single-insertions; not for bulk operations.</i>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Queries

Various types of queries are available for each collection. The `query` submodule is for single-object based queries, while the `generate` submodule is for RAG queries and `aggregate` for aggregation.

You can use different methods such as `hybrid`, `near_text` and so on within each submodule.

We've tried to keep methods as consistent as possible. So after you've tried object queries, you can enhance it to RAG queries by switching to the `generate` submodule, and provide any additional parameters as required for the prompts!

This makes it easy to switch between the different query types, and to discover the different query types available.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="hybrid" label="Hybrid">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START HybridQueryExample"
            endMarker="# END HybridQueryExample"
            language="py"
        />
        <p><small>The search query returns a parsed response, with the <code>.objects</code> property containing the retrieved Weaviate objects.</small></p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="neartext" label="NearText">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START NearTextQueryExample"
            endMarker="# END NearTextQueryExample"
            language="py"
        />
        <p><small>The search query returns a parsed response, with the <code>.objects</code> property containing the retrieved Weaviate objects.</small></p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="rag" label="NearText + RAG">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START NearTextGenerateExample"
            endMarker="# END NearTextGenerateExample"
            language="py"
        />
        <p><small>The RAG query is very similar to the equivalent search query, but using methods in the <code>generate</code> submodule.</small></p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="filter" label="Aggregate + Filter">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START AggregateCountExample"
            endMarker="# END AggregateCountExample"
            language="py"
        />
        <p><small>This example retrieves a count of objects that match the filter criteria.</small></p><br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Returned data

As mentioned before, the default behavior now is to return all properties (except `blob`s and references) by default, as well as object uuids.

For less-often used attributes such as cross-references, metadata (previously under `_additional`) and vectors must be requested specifically. This is done through the `return_references`, `return_metadata` and `include_vector` parameters.

Note in the example below how the `MetadataQuery` and `QueryReference` classes reduce the amount of syntax memorization required to request metadata or cross-referenced data.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="custom" label="Specify returns">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BM25QueryCustomReturnsExample"
            endMarker="# END BM25QueryCustomReturnsExample"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="default" label="Default returns">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# START BM25QueryDefaultReturnsExample"
            endMarker="# END BM25QueryDefaultReturnsExample"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Responses

Responses from Weaviate are now parsed into instances of custom classes. For example, each query response will have a list of objects in the `objects` attribute, and each object will have a set of attributes itself. Responses for RAG queries will include a `generated` attribute at the top level for `grouped_task` query, and each object will also have a `generated` attribute for `single_prompt` queries.

### Iterator

The client includes an iterator to make convenient use of the `cursor` API. This is useful for retrieving large numbers of objects, such as when [manually exporting](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects) or [migrating a collection](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/migrate).

<Tabs groupId="languages">
    <TabItem value="basic" label="Default">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# IteratorBasic"
            endMarker="# END IteratorBasic"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="oneprop" label="Selected properties">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# IteratorAnswerOnly"
            endMarker="# END IteratorAnswerOnly"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="meta" label="Get metadata">
        <FilteredTextBlock
            text={PythonCode}
            startMarker="# IteratorWithMetadata"
            endMarker="# END IteratorWithMetadata"
            language="py"
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `len`

You can even get the size of the collection by using the built-in `len` function - like this!

<FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# START LenCollectionExample"
    endMarker="# END LenCollectionExample"
    language="py"
/>
