## Introduction

Learning how to effectively use and integrate Weaviate Cloud (WCD) queries into your iOS or macOS applications can be challenging. This article simplifies the process by focusing on the various types of queries available and providing a live tool for you to run them. We’ll offer a detailed explanation of common and easily implemented query types, and you can see the results in real-time. Additionally, Mac users can download our custom application to run live examples directly on their laptops, allowing them to copy and paste these queries as templates for their own projects.

The content is based on Adam Chan's Book Recommendation project found at this Git repo [here](https://github.com/weaviate/BookRecs).

## Searching a Vector Database

Imagine you have a giant library with books described by numbers instead of words. A [vector
similarity search](/blog/vector-search-explained) is like a special tool that helps you find books similar to the one you're holding
by comparing their numbers. It's faster than reading every book description and works well for
things like finding similar images or recommending products.

Let's say you're in the library and love a particular mystery novel. This book can be represented
by a vector, a fancy way of saying it's a bunch of numbers that capture information about the
book. These numbers might encode things like genre, character count, or how many times certain
words appear.

Now, you want to find other similar mystery novels. The library (or the Weaviate platform in this
case) uses the same kind of number code (vector) for all the books. The search tool then
compares the vector of your favorite book to all the others. Books with similar vectors, meaning
their numbers are close together, are likely similar mystery novels you might enjoy. This way,
you can find new reads without sifting through every single book description.

## Weaviate Cloud (WCD)
Weaviate Cloud is a fully managed cloud service that provides a vector database, simplifying the
creation and deployment of AI applications. It handles the infrastructure, letting developers focus
on building features like semantic search and recommendation engines. WCD offers flexible
hosting options, including serverless and enterprise plans, built upon the powerful open-source
Weaviate database.

## Core Concepts

This guide utilizes the Query Helper Application, a custom MacOS app signed by Apple,
designed for live testing of Weaviate Queries.

Before using the application, you'll need to set up API keys. The following keys are relevant:

1. Weaviate API Key: Provides access to the Weaviate Vector Database holding your
domain data. For this demo app, the Weaviate API key is pre-defined and cannot be
changed.
1. OpenAI API Key: Used by Weaviate to access OpenAI's Large Language Models for
querying embeddings. You can create a key at OpenAI.
1. Cohere API Key: Utilized by Weaviate for text embedding, generative AI, and
reranking. A key can be created at Cohere.

API keys can be configured within the application by clicking the settings icon to open the API Key Settings Panel.

## Query Prompt Examples

This article discusses several types of queries, all of which require a Weaviate API key. Depending on the specific query type being executed, an additional OpenAI and/or Cohere API key may also be necessary. While the required Weaviate API key is already provided, users should be aware that further API keys may be needed for certain operations.

**Primary:** Fundamental options for querying data.

- **Basic:** A simple query that retrieves a limited amount of items
- **Third Item:**  Skip to the third item of a query
- **Meta Data:** Properties (eg. ID, creation date, last update date, etc) available that go beyond the original values loaded on to the vector database

**Reorder:** Rearranging or prioritizing the data.

- **Move Away:**  Allow users to prioritize similar terms/concepts and deemphasize others. (+Open AI Key)
- **ReRank:** Change the order in which data elements are displayed, perhaps based on specific criteria. (+Open AI Key, Cohere Key)

**Aggregate:** Summarizing count data.

- **By Category:** Group counts based on specific attributes.
- **Grand Total:** Total count of the entire dataset.

**Single Result:** RAG processing resulting in a single result.

- **Summary:** Summary of a specific query.  (+Open AI Key, Cohere Key)
- **Translate To:** Translate data elements or results into different languages.  (+Open AI Key, Cohere Key)
- **Translate From/To:** Translate data elements or results from different languages to different languages.  (+Open AI Key, Cohere Key)

**Grouped Result:** Grouping or organizing data using RAG

- **Grouped Result:** Perform prompt on all records retrieved from another prompt. (+Open AI Key, Cohere Key)

### Primary

** Basic **

The basic building block for creating a query.

Example: Get the first 5 Books and list the title, number of pages and description.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(limit: 5) {
      title
      num_pages
      description
    }
  }
}
```


**Third Item**

Query starting from the third record.

Example: Using the Basic Query as a starter, skip the first two books and start from the book that follows. Example: Starting from the 3rd book: list the title, number of pages and description of the next 5.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(limit: 5, offset: 2) {
      title
      num_pages
      description
    }
  }
}
```


**Meta Data**

Show information that extends beyond the initial domain data loaded. This is data generated by the system.

Example: Include ID, creation date, last update date.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(limit: 5) {
      title
      _additional {
        id
        vector
        certainty
        score
        distance
        creationTimeUnix
        lastUpdateTimeUnix
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Reorder

**Move Away**

Allow users to prioritize similar concepts and deemphasize others. Example: Emphasize “war” themes and deemphasize “romance”.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(
      limit: 5
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Mysteries set in Western Europe"]
        distance: 0.6
        moveAwayFrom: { concepts: ["romance"], force: 0.45 }
        moveTo: { concepts: ["war"], force: 0.85 }
      }
    ) {
      title
      description
      num_pages
    }
  }
}
```


**Rerank**

Change the order in which data elements are displayed based on specific criteria. This is data generated by the system.

Example: The result is reranked to prioritize descriptions that discuss robots.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(nearText: { concepts: "science fiction" }, limit: 10) {
      title
      description
      num_pages
      categories
      _additional {
        distance
        rerank(property: "description", query: "robot") {
          score
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Aggregate

**By Category**

Group counts based on specific attributes.

Example: Show the number of books for each category.

```
{
  Aggregate {
    Book(groupBy: ["categories"]) {
      meta {
        count
      }
      groupedBy {
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Grand Total**

Total count of the entire dataset.

Example: Show the count of all books in the database.

```
{
  Aggregate {
    Book {
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Single Result

**Summary**

Summary of a specific query.

Example: Summarize in 10 words books with a mystery theme that occur in Western Europe.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(
      nearText: { concepts: ["Search for mysteries set in WesternEurope"] }
      limit: 5
    ) {
      title
      description
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: {
            prompt: "Describe the following as a short summary in 10 words:{description}"
          }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```


**Translate To**

Translate data elements or results into different languages.

Example: Search for Mexican books and translate the title into Spanish.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(nearText: { concepts: ["What books are Mexican"] }, limit: 5) {
      title
      description
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: { prompt: "Translate the following in Spanish:{title}" }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Translate From/To**

Translate data elements or results from different languages to different languages. Example: Ask a question in Spanish and translate the title into Spanish.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(nearText: { concepts: ["Que libros son mexicanos"] }, limit: 5) {
      title
      description
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: { prompt: "Translate the following in Spanish:{title}" }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Grouped Result

**Grouped Result**

Perform prompt on all records retrieved from another prompt. Example: Search for books about the governments in Europe.

Summarize what the leaders of the result have in common.

```
{
  Get {
    Book(nearText: { concepts: ["Governments of Europe"] }, limit: 5) {
      title
      description
      _additional {
        generate(
          groupedResult: {
            task: "What do these leaders have in common, if anything?"
          }
        ) {
          groupedResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
