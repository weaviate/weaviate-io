![Enterprise Security with Weaviate](./img/hero.png)

A data scientist runs a bulk update without a `WHERE` clause. An intern accidentally exposes customer PII through a search API. An agentic application deletes a production database.

During development, these are mistakes. For enterprises, they are potential regulatory violations, breach disclosures, and multi-million dollar incidents.

As vector databases transition from experimental sandboxes to critical infrastructure powering AI applications, security requirements become non-negotiable. Organizations cannot rely on shared API keys or basic authentication. They need centralized identity management, granular access controls, compliance-ready logging, and seamless integration with existing security stacks.

Weaviate meets these rigorous demands through:

- [**Single Sign-On (SSO)**](#single-sign-on-and-identity-provider-integration)
- [**OIDC integration**](#single-sign-on-and-identity-provider-integration)
- [**group-based role management**](#oidc-groups-scaling-role-management) and
- [**comprehensive audit logging**](#audit-logging-and-compliance).

Whether you are in financial services, healthcare, government, or any regulated industry, Weaviate provides the governance controls necessary to move AI into production safely.

## Why Enterprise Security Is Different

Enterprise security isn't just about stronger passwords—it's about scale, governance, and regulatory adherence (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI DSS, FedRAMP).

While a startup might manage five users manually, an enterprise faces distinct operational challenges:

- **Identity Sprawl:** Managing users across hundreds of systems creates friction and security gaps.
- **The "Bus Factor":** Manual provisioning depends on specific administrators, leading to bottlenecks.
- **Offboarding Risks:** When an employee leaves, access must be revoked instantly across all systems to prevent insider threats.
- **Shadow IT:** If security is too difficult to implement, teams will bypass it.

Most enterprises have already invested heavily in identity infrastructure like **Okta**, **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**, or **Auth0**. Effective modern security must integrate with what already exists rather than requiring yet another isolated credential store.

## Single Sign-On and Identity Provider Integration

SSO through OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration is the bedrock of enterprise security in Weaviate Cloud.

By adopting a "Bring Your Own Identity" approach, Weaviate eliminates the need to create new usernames and passwords. Users authenticate with your existing Identity Provider (IdP). When an employee joins, they are provisioned once in your IdP. When they leave, they are deprovisioned there, and access to Weaviate is instantly revoked.

**The Security Architecture:**

1.  **Delegated Authentication:** Users authenticate with your IdP, not Weaviate.
2.  **Token-Based Access:** The IdP generates a short-lived, cryptographically signed JSON Web Token (JWT).
3.  **Zero-Knowledge:** Weaviate validates the token but never sees or stores user credentials.

This architecture drastically reduces your attack surface. Even in the unlikely event of a database compromise, there are no passwords to steal—only expired or short-lived tokens. Weaviate supports **any OIDC-compliant identity provider**, giving you the flexibility to use your preferred infrastructure.

## OIDC Groups: Scaling Role Management

Managing individual user permissions is impossible at scale. If you have 500 developers and 200 data scientists, mapping roles one by one is an operational nightmare that invites human error.

**OIDC Groups** solve this by mapping your existing organizational structure directly to Weaviate roles.

Your identity provider already knows who belongs to `developers`, `data-scientists`, and `analytics-team`. You can configure Weaviate to trust these group claims. When a user's group membership changes in your IdP (e.g., a promotion or team switch), Weaviate automatically reflects this permission change on their next login.

### Example: Automated Access Control

Imagine a financial services company using Microsoft Entra ID. They can map their AD groups to Weaviate roles:

| Microsoft Entra ID Group | Weaviate Role   | Access Level              |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Engineering-Backend`    | `Maintainer`    | Read-write prod, full dev |
| `Engineering-ML`         | `DataScientist` | Read-only prod, full dev  |
| `Contractors-Eng`        | `DevOnly`       | Dev access only           |

**The Result:**

- **Zero-Touch Onboarding:** A new contractor is added to the AD group and immediately gains the correct Weaviate access.
- **Instant Revocation:** Removing a user from the AD group instantly revokes their specific privileges.
- **Audit Simplicity:** Auditors only need to check the IdP group membership, treating Weaviate as a downstream consumer of identity truth.

## Enterprise RBAC at Scale

Beyond basic login, enterprises need sophisticated Authorization policies. Weaviate’s Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows for granular permissions down to the collection and API level.

Let's look at **AcmeCo**, an e-commerce enterprise using Weaviate for product search and personalization. They have three distinct data categories:

1.  **Products:** Public catalog data.
2.  **CustomerBehavior:** Sensitive PII.
3.  **InternalAnalytics:** Business intelligence data.

They implement a strict "Least Privilege" model:

| Role              | Products      | CustomerBehavior | InternalAnalytics | Dev Collections |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| **Administrator** | Full CRUD     | Full CRUD        | Full CRUD         | Full CRUD       |
| **Maintainer**    | Read & Update | Read & Update    | Read & Update     | Full CRUD       |
| **DataScientist** | Read only     | Read only        | Read only         | Full CRUD       |
| **SearchApp**     | Read only     | **No Access**    | **No Access**     | **No Access**   |

**Scenario 1: API Security**
The Search Service authenticates as `SearchApp`. It can query `Products` to serve user traffic. If an attacker compromises this API key and attempts to query `CustomerBehavior`, Weaviate denies the request. The blast radius is contained.

**Scenario 2: Developer Safety**
"Charlie," a Machine Learning Engineer, authenticates via Okta and receives the `DataScientist` role. Charlie can read production data to train models and has full control over Dev collections. However, if Charlie accidentally runs a `DELETE` query against Production, Weaviate blocks the action. No data is lost, and operations continue without interruption.

## Audit Logging and Compliance

In regulated industries, if it wasn't logged, it didn't happen.

- **GDPR Article 30** requires records of processing activities.
- **HIPAA** requires audit trails for all PHI access.
- **SOC 2** demands evidence of sensitive data access monitoring.

Weaviate provides comprehensive audit logging that tracks:

- **Authentication Events:** Successes and failures.
- **RBAC Checks:** Every permission grant or denial.
- **Role Modifications:** Who changed permissions and when.
- **Data Access:** Context on resources targeted.

Each log entry includes the timestamp, user identity, action attempted, source IP, and result. These logs are designed to be ingested by SIEM systems (like Splunk, QRadar, or Datadog) for real-time threat detection and long-term compliance archiving.

## Weaviate Managed Cloud: Enterprise-Ready Infrastructure

While Weaviate Shared Cloud provides excellent baseline security, **Managed Cloud** offers features specifically designed for the complexity and compliance needs of large organizations.

Managed Cloud deployments include:

- **Dedicated Infrastructure:** Physical isolation with no "noisy neighbors."
- **Advanced IdP Integration:** Full support for custom OIDC providers and Group mapping.
- **Enhanced Auditing:** Longer log retention and simplified SIEM export.
- **SLA Guarantees:** Financially backed uptime and support response times.
- **Compliance Support:** Architecture eligible for SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA environments.

## Implementation Roadmap

Rolling out enterprise security follows a predictable lifecycle. Here is a typical path to production:

1.  **Discovery (Week 1):** Map your data sensitivity levels. Identify which IdP groups map to which logical roles (Admin, Dev, Viewer).
2.  **Architecture (Week 2):** Define your custom roles in Weaviate using the `authorization` configuration.
3.  **Integration (Week 3):** Configure OIDC in your IdP (e.g., create the App Registration in Azure AD) and connect it to Weaviate.
4.  **Testing (Week 4):** Verify that adding a user to an IdP group grants the correct permissions and—crucially—that removing them revokes access.
5.  **Operations (Ongoing):** Configure log shipping to your SIEM and set up alerts for "Access Denied" spikes or administrative role changes.

## Conclusion

Enterprise security is about integration, not isolation. Weaviate meets enterprises where they are—integrating with existing identity providers, respecting organizational structures through OIDC groups, and providing compliance-ready audit trails.
