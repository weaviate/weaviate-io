# Overview

Unfold the power of generative AI within your iOS and MacOS projects using Weaviate and Apple Dev Tools. This step-by-step guide will equip you to seamlessly integrate Weaviate's generative AI capabilities with Apple's development environment.

Inject a shot of Python power into your Xcode workflow for MacOS apps! Leverage Python scripting to streamline Weaviate database creation and tap into the vast potential of native Python frameworks - including frameworks that specialize in data science tasks.

Gain the ability to utilize generative AI models directly within your applications, unlocking innovative features and functionalities for yourself and your users.

This article assumes little or no working knowledge of python, generative AI or Weaviate.

# Resources

A number of articles and working code (Swift, SwiftUI and Python) are included to help you with your journey.

To run some of the code, you will need an OpenAI Key which you can get for free.

Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/).

Each article is designed to be followed in the following sequence.
