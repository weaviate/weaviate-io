## Introduction

We want to ensure that Weaviate is not just powerful, but also user-friendly.

After all, the best tools are those that are accessible and easy to integrate into your projects. This is why we prioritize client libraries for different programming languages.

Today, we're thrilled to unveil our pre-release `collections` Python client API. We've designed it to be more Pythonic, leveraging modern IDE features like code completion and type hints. Moreover, we've revamped the way you work with your data.

While our internal tests have yielded positive results, we are excited to see what you, the community, think. So, we invite you to explore this new API, share your insights, and even contribute to its evolution.

Let's dive into the inspiration and core concepts behind this innovation.

:::note 'Collection' vs 'Class' nomenclature
Going forward, we will use the term `collection` instead of `class` to refer to the sets of objects to be stored in Weaviate. This is to avoid confusion with the generic word `class` in object-oriented programming, and in Python.
:::

## Key changes

> **Highlights: Strong typing through custom Python classes, focus on individual collections for interaction**

There are two key changes to the way the `collections` client works in comparison to the existing Python client (let's call this the `Classic` client). They relate to the object typing and the way you interact with the data.

| **Aspect** | **`Classic` Client** | **`Collections` Client** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Object Typing** | Primarily relied on untyped `dict` / JSONs. | Utilizes strong typing through custom Python classes. |
| **Unit of Interaction** | Interacts with the entire database. | Focuses on individual collections for interaction. |

Let's look at each of these in more detail.

### Object typing

The `Classic` client primarily relied on untyped data structures like dictionaries and JSONs. While this approach offered flexibility, we saw this lead to runtime errors. Recognizing this, the collections client takes a leap forward by adding strong typing through custom Python classes in many places.

Compare the following syntax, for example:

:::note Classic client syntax

```python
collection_definition = {
    "class": "Article",
    "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai",
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "title",
            "dataType": ["text"]
        },
    ]
}
client.schema.add_class(collection_definition)
```

:::

:::info `Collections` client syntax

```python
import weaviate.classes as wvc  # <-- import the custom classes

client.collection.create(
    name="Article",
    vectorizer_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(),
    properties=[
        wvc.Property(
            name="title",
            data_type=wvc.DataType.TEXT,
        ),
    ]
)
```

:::

And what's more, you get all the benefits of strong typing, including code completion and type hints in your IDE.
Take a look at how little actual typing is required to create the above collection, thanks to the IDE support:

import codeCompletionImgUrl from './img/code-completion.gif';

<img src={codeCompletionImgUrl} alt="Code completion and type hints are added in the new Python client" width="85%"/>

As a user, you will now only interact with the Python API itself and its surface rather than needing know the underlying API's surface as well. In other words, you do not have to remember the exact API parameter names, as the IDE will show you the available options. This can be a boon when you are working with less often-used options or when you are new to Weaviate.

Take a look at the next example, where we are configuring the `invertedIndexConfig` for a property. The IDE shows us the available options and their descriptions.

import invertedIndexHintsImgUrl from './img/inverted-index-hints.png';

<img src={invertedIndexHintsImgUrl} alt="Tool tip hints for inverted index configurations" width="85%"/>

Types are introduced for the data objects as well at creation time, as well as when retrieving them from the database. This means that you can access the properties of the data object directly.

So syntax that is currently like this:

:::note Classic client syntax
```python
response['data']['Get']['Article'][0]['title']  # Get the `title` property of the first object
response['data']['Get']['Article'][0]['_additional']['id']  # Get the ID of the first object
response['data']['Get']['Article'][0]['_additional']['generate']['singleResult']  # Get the generated text from a `singlePrompt` request
response['data']['Get']['Article'][0]['_additional']['generate']['groupedResult']  # Get the generated text from a `groupedTask` request
```

:::

Become:

:::info `Collections` client syntax

```python
response.objects[0].properties['title']  # Get the `title` property of the first object
response.objects[0].metadata.uuid  # Get the ID of the first object
response.objects[0].generated  # Get the generated text from a `singlePrompt` request
response.generated  # Get the generated text from a `groupedTask` request
```

:::

We think that these changes will reduce errors, increase productivity, and make the code easier to read and understand.

### Collections-first approach

The other big change is that the `collections` client focuses on individual collections for interaction.

This means that you will no longer need to specify the collection name in every request. Instead, you will create an object for each collection that you want to interact with, and then use that object for all subsequent requests.

For example, take the following syntax for performing a simple `Get` request to retrieve a few objects from the database:

:::note Classic client syntax

```python
response = (
    client.query.get(
        class_name="Article",
        properties=["title", "body", "url"]
    )
    .with_limit(2)
    .do()
)
```

:::

Becomes:

:::info `Collections` client syntax

```python
articles = client.collection.get("Article")
response = articles.query.fetch_objects(limit=2)
```

:::

You'll see that a search is now a method that originates from the collection object.

We have observed that in most cases, you will be working with a single collection at a time. So, we think that this change will improve your efficiency and make the code more readable.

This is the same for all searches, retrieval augmented generations, and data operations such as insertion, deletion, and updating. You can access these methods through submodules like:

```python
articles.data  # For data operations
articles.query  # For searches
articles.generate  # For retrieval augmented generations
```

## Quality-of-life improvements

As well as making these big philosophical changes, we've also made a number of quality-of-life improvements to the API.

### Simplified methods

Standalone methods with parameters now replace the builder pattern (`with_` methods) for queries. So what used to be a chain of methods like this:

:::note Classic client syntax

```python
response = (
    client.query.get(
        class_name="JeopardyQuestion",
        properties=["question", "answer"]
    )
    .with_near_text({"concepts": ["the space race"]})
    .with_generate(
        grouped_task="Write a haiku about these facts!",
    )
    .with_limit(2)
    .do()
)
```

:::

Becomes:

:::info `Collections` client syntax

```python
questions = client.collection.get("JeopardyQuestion")
response = questions.generate.near_text(
    query="the space race",
    limit=2,
    grouped_task="Write a haiku about these facts!"
)
```

:::

### Easier defaults

You might have noticed that above examples do not specify properties to be returned!

We have changed the default behavior to return all properties and even most of the metadata such as the object ID, creation time, vector search distance and so on. We think this will make it easier to get started, and for production use-cases where you want to optimize the response size, you can still specify the properties you want to return.

### Import error handling

## Performance improvements

> **Highlights: Up to 60-80% faster imports, 3-4x faster queries**

While a big part of this `collections` client release has been about improving the developer experience, there has been some significant performance improvements as well.

Under the hood, we expand on Weaviate's gRPC [(what is it?)](https://grpc.io/) capabilities that has been ongoing since [`v1.19` release](/blog/weaviate-1-19-release#grpc-api-support-experimental).

The short story is that your query performance and import performance will be significantly improved.

### Import speeds

We've internally seen that data import with new client using gRPC achieves a 60-80% speedup compared to the current client using REST. For production use cases involving tens or hundreds of millions of objects, this can mean significant reduction in the hours spent getting your database ready.

### Query speeds

But that's not all. Even a query will execute much faster with the new client using gRPC, in comparison with the current client using GraphQL. We've seen that a small query executes 3-4 times faster(!) with the new client.

### How was this achieved?

These speed-ups come from two benefits of using gRPC, which is a binary protocol. This means that one, the data is sent in a compact binary format, rather than as text, which reduces the volume of data to be sent. The other factor is that to send data as text, it needs to be marshalled which is a computationally expensive process. With gRPC, the data is sent in a binary format, which is much faster to marshall and unmarshall.

We won't get into the details of gRPC here, but if you are interested, you can read more about it [here](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/). We will also be writing more about it in the future.

## More about object typing

We've mentioned object typing a few times already, but let's take a closer look at a few more concrete examples:

### Collection definition

You've seen some of these benefits already, so we won't go into too much detail here. But note that many of the previously complex options such as vectorizer, generative module, index configurations, and so on are now defined through a `ConfigFactory` class:

```python
articles = client.collection.create(
    name="Article",
    # highlight-start
    vectorizer_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(),
    generative_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.Generative.openai(),
    replication_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.replication(factor=1),
    inverted_index_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.inverted_index(
        index_property_length=True
    )
    # highlight-end
)
```

### Queries

Because each query is now one method, you can see the available options in your IDE. Furthermore, options like defining filters or metadata that were defined through string parameters in the `Classic` client are now defined through custom Python classes.

import nearTextQueryImgUrl from './img/neartext_query_hints.gif';

<img src={nearTextQueryImgUrl} alt="IDE autocompletion in queries have been added" width="85%"/>

### Retrieval augmented generation

As you saw briefly earlier, we have a `.generate` submodule for retrieval augmented generation.

The structure of these mirror those of the queries, with additional parameters added for the generation task. For example, this query:

```python
response = questions.query.near_text(
    query="the space race",
    limit=2,
)
```

Can be converted to a retrieval augmented generation task by switching the submodule to `.generate` and adding the `grouped_task` parameter:

```python
# highlight-start
response = questions.generate.near_text(
# highlight-end
    query="the space race",
    limit=2,
    # highlight-start
    grouped_task="Write a haiku about these facts!"
    # highlight-end
)
```

### Data operations

Object insertion also gets a refresh, with the introduction of a `DataObject` class. This class is used to define the properties of the object to be inserted, and is then passed to the `insert_many` method.

```python
from weaviate.util import generate_uuid5

articles_to_add = list()
for i, row in enumerate(data_source):
    # highlight-start
    article_obj = wvc.DataObject(
        properties={
            "title": row["title"],
            "body": row["title"],
        },
        vector=vectors[i],
        uuid=generate_uuid5(row["title"])
    )
    # highlight-end
    articles_to_add.append(article_obj)


response = articles.data.insert_many(articles_to_add)
print(response)
```

This provides a more intuitive and structured way to define objects, where each object can be validated through the `DataObject` class.
