![Build Scalable Gen AI Data Pipelines with Weaviate and Databricks ](./img/hero.png)

Building generative AI applications at large enterprises requires data pipelines that integrate data from numerous sources and ensure optimized performance. With [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), the vector database built for Gen AI applications, and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), an industry-leading data platform, we’ve created a powerful suite of integrations designed to streamline AI workflows and deliver an exceptional developer experience. From calling models hosted on Databricks to efficient data handling, Weaviate provides a tightly integrated, end-to-end solution. 

The Weaviate [Spark Connector](https://github.com/weaviate/spark-connector)—developed in collaboration with our partners at [SmartCat](https://smartcat.io/)—is the latest addition to this suite, enabling seamless data ingestion into Weaviate through the Apache Spark™s DataFrame API. This post will guide you through incorporating our Spark Connector into your Databricks workflows. We’ll start with a brief walkthrough for setting up your Databricks cluster, defining a Weaviate collection, ingesting data, and running your first hybrid and generative search queries.

You can find the notebook in the Weaviate recipe repository [here](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/data-platforms/databricks/databricks-spark-connector.ipynb).

## Architecture 

The Spark Connector is a jar library that implements Spark’s DataWriter interface. This means that writing data to Weaviate is as simple as calling Spark’s `write` method on a DataFrame. You don’t have to worry about tedious technical details like batching or data partitioning; the Spark runtime and connector handle these efficiently under the hood.

## Installation

To get the demo notebook running on your Databricks cluster, we’ll go over a couple of quick setup steps starting with installing libraries and then setting environment variables. 

### Installing the Spark Connector 

The `spark-connector` jar is available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.spark/spark-connect_2.13), and you can add it to your cluster as a cluster scoped library. Use the coordinate `io.weaviate:spark-connector_2.12:1.3.3`. Head to your cluster settings, open the `Libraries` tab, and select `Install New` → `Maven`. Drop in the coordinate, and you’re all set.

### Adding the Weaviate Client

Since we’re working in Python, you’ll also need the weaviate-client package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/weaviate-client/). You can install this through your cluster's Libraries tab, similar to the spark-connector:

![Install the Weaviate Client](./img/install-weaviate.png)

### Setting Environment Variable

For a secure connection, configure the following environment variables as Secrets in Databricks: 

* `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`:  Your Databricks personal access token   
* `EMBEDDINGS_ENDPOINT` and `LLM_ENDPOINT`: The serving endpoints for your models served through the Databricks Foundation Model API—one for Embedding task and one for Chat task.   
* `WEAVIATE_URL` and `WEAVIATE_API_KEY`:  For connecting to your Weaviate instance, especially if using Weaviate Cloud.

## Connect to your Weaviate Cluster

For this demo, we’ll connect to our [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) cluster and use the Databricks module to vectorize our data and connect to a language model.

```python
client = weaviate.connect_to_wcs(
    cluster_url=WEAVIATE_URL,
    auth_credentials=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(WEAVIATE_API_KEY),
      headers={ "X-Databricks-Token": DATABRICKS_TOKEN}
)

print(client.is_ready())
```

## Preparing the Dataset to Ingest 

To keep things simple, we’ll use a sample dataset readily available from the Databricks Marketplace. We are using a dataset which provides a variety of products on Amazon.

`bright_data_amazon_best_seller_products_reviews_products_dataset`

For this tutorial, we’ll focus on just two columns: 

`title`:  Title of the product

`description`:  Description of the product

```python
table_name = "bright_data_amazon_best_seller_products_reviews_products_dataset.datasets.amazon_best_seller_products"

df = spark.table(table_name).select("title", "description").limit(10)
display(df)
```

To uniquely identify each row, we’ll also add a uuid column, and we’ll keep it light by using only the first rows. 

Here’s a quick code snippet showing how to load and transform the dataset to include a `uuid`:

```python
def create_uuid(title, description):
    obj = {
        "title": title,
        "description": description
    }
    return str(generate_uuid5(obj))

create_uuid_udf = udf(create_uuid, StringType())

df = df.withColumn("uuid", create_uuid_udf(df["title"], df["description"]))\
        .select("uuid", "title", "description")

display(df)
```

With this simple transformation, our data is prepped and ready for ingestion into Weaviate. 

## Creating the Weaviate Collection 

We need to create a Weaviate collection that matches the DataFrame we just defined. To do this, we define the following: 

```python
if client.collections.exists("AmazonProducts"):
    client.collections.delete("AmazonProducts")

collection = client.collections.create(
    name="AmazonProducts",
    vectorizer_config=[
        wvcc.Configure.NamedVectors.text2vec_databricks(
            name="default", 
            endpoint=EMBEDDINGS_ENDPOINT
        )
    ],
    generative_config=wvcc.Configure.Generative.databricks(
        endpoint=LLM_ENDPOINT, 
        max_tokens=8092
    ),
    properties=[
        wvcc.Property(
            name="title",
            data_type=wvcc.DataType.TEXT
        ),
        wvcc.Property(
            name="description",
            data_type=wvcc.DataType.TEXT
        )
    ]
)
    
collection = client.collections.get("AmazonProducts")
```

We’ve created an AmazonProducts collection with two properties, title and description, which aligns with the columns in our DataFrame. Additionally, the collection is using the [Databricks module](/developers/weaviate/model-providers/databricks) to: 

* Vectorize Objects (`vectorizer_config`): The `text2vec_databricks` configuration enables Weaviate to generate embeddings for the Amazon products using the Databricks endpoint specified in `EMBEDDINGS_ENDPOINT`.   
* Generative Model (`generative_config`): The `generative_databricks` configuration connects to a Databricks hosted large language model at `LLM_ENDPOINT`, to enable generative search.

## Ingesting the Data 

We can now ingest data into our `AmazonProducts` collection:

```python
df.write.format("io.weaviate.spark.Weaviate") \
    .option("batchSize", 200) \
    .option("scheme", "https") \
    .option("host", WEAVIATE_URL.replace("https://","")) \
    .option("apiKey", WEAVIATE_API_KEY) \
    .option("header:X-Databricks-Token", DATABRICKS_TOKEN) \
    .option("className", "AmazonProducts") \
    .option("id", "uuid") \
    .mode("append") \
    .save()
```

In this code snippet, the options used are: 

* `batchSize`: Specifies the number of rows ingested per batch for optimal performance   
* `host`, `apiKey`, `header:X-Databricks-Token`: Connect securely to your Weaviate instance and authenticate with Databricks   
* `className`: Points to the `AmazonProducts` collection we created earlier   
* `id`: Tells Weaviate to use the uuid column as the unique identifier for each entry 

## Search Time

With the data now in Weaviate, we’re all set to run a few queries. We’ll first retrieve the `AmazonProducts` collection so we can use it for each query.

```python
products = client.collections.get("AmazonProducts")
```

### Hybrid Search

The alpha parameter determines the weight given to the sparse and dense search methods. `alpha = 0` is pure sparse (bm25) search, whereas `alpha = 1` is pure dense (vector) search.

Alpha is an optional parameter. The default is set to `0.75`.

Let’s find products that can be used to stay dry in the rain:

```python
response = products.query.hybrid(
    query="stay dry in the rain",
    query_properties=["title"],
    alpha=0.7,
    limit=2
)

for item in response.objects:
    print(json.dumps(item.properties, indent=2), "\n")
```

### Vector Search

Vector search returns the objects with most similar vectors to that of the query. We’ll run a vector search query to find products that are needed in a home.

```python
response = products.query.near_text(
    query="home essentials",
    limit=2
)

for item in response.objects:
    print(json.dumps(item.properties, indent=2), "\n")
```

### Generative Search (RAG)

We can take it a step further and leverage generative search to explain why each product is needed in my home.

```python
generate_prompt = "Explain why each product is needed in my home."

response = products.generate.near_text(
    query="home essentials",
    return_properties=["title", "description"],
    grouped_task=generate_prompt,
    limit=2
)

print(response.generated)
```

The output is:

```txt
Here's why each product is needed in your home:

1. **Bare Home 100% Organic Cotton Queen Sheet Set**: This product is needed in your home for a comfortable and healthy sleep. The sheet set is made of 100% organic cotton, which is breathable, soft, and gentle on your skin. It's also free of toxic chemicals, ensuring a safe and healthy sleep environment.
