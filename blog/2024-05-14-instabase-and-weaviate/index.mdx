In March we hosted our first-ever roadshow in San Francisco, inviting tech leaders who use Weaviate to share their experiences of building AI applications in production. Our CTO, Etienne, sat down with Shaunak Godbole, Head of Infrastructure Engineering at [Instabase](https://www.instabase.com/), to discuss the latest developments in intelligent document processing and automation technologies. 

Instabase leverages AI to streamline operations and enhance efficiency across various industries, including banking, insurance, and ride-sharing platforms like Uber. The discussion highlighted Instabase’s innovative approaches to handling complex data challenges and their strategic implementation of technologies like Weaviate to stay ahead in a highly competitive and evolving landscape.

### Here are three key takeaways from the conversation: 

1. **Generative AI can solve highly complex problems**: Instabase strategically uses GenAI to transform unstructured data into actionable insights. It’s not just a prototype, but a core part of their platform in production, already benefiting large organizations with high volume document handling needs. 

2. **Flexibility in technology deployment is key**: Enterprises in various industries need solutions that conform to strict regulatory standards and data residency requirements across different regions and cloud infrastructures. Products that serve them best are informed by the needs of their use cases and are built with tech stacks that can adapt to these needs.

3. **Products must actively evolve to best support customers**: This approach was underscored by Instabase’s transition to more sophisticated AI models that support a diverse range of applications, from large-scale enterprise solutions to accessible tools for small businesses and educational purposes.

For a deeper understanding of these insights and how Instabase and Weaviate are pushing the boundaries of GenAI and engineering, watch the full video of the talk.
