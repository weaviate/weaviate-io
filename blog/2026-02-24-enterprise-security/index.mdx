![Enterprise Security with Weaviate](./img/hero.png)

You've probably heard the horror stories. A data scientist runs a bulk update without a `WHERE` clause and accidentally wipes production data. An intern exposes customer PII through a poorly secured search API. An agentic application with the wrong permissions deletes an entire database before anyone notices. During development, these are fixable mistakes. For enterprises, they're potential regulatory violations, breach disclosures, and multi-million dollar incidents.

As vector databases transition from experimental sandboxes to critical infrastructure powering AI applications, security requirements become non-negotiable. Organizations can't rely on shared API keys or basic authentication anymore. They need **centralized identity management**, **granular access controls**, **compliance-ready logging**, and painless **integration with existing security infrastructure**.

Weaviate meets these security demands through:

- [**OIDC integration**](#oidc-integration) for authentication
- [**Single Sign-On (SSO)**](#sso) in Weaviate Cloud
- [**Group-based role management**](#oidc-groups-scaling-role-management) for organized access control
- [**Comprehensive audit logging**](#audit-logging-and-compliance)

Whether you are in financial services, healthcare, government, or any regulated industry, Weaviate provides the security controls necessary to move AI into production safely.

## Why Enterprise Security Is Different

Enterprise security isn't just about stronger passwords. It's about scale, governance, and regulatory adherence (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI DSS, FedRAMP).

The problems start to compound at scale. A startup might manage five users manually, but enterprises face operational challenges. You might have hundreds of users spread across different systems, creating friction and security gaps. Manual provisioning becomes a bottleneck that depends on specific administrators. When an employee leaves, their access must be revoked instantly across all systems to prevent insider threats. 


Most enterprises have already invested heavily in identity infrastructure like Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), or Auth0. Effective modern security must integrate with what already exists rather than requiring yet another isolated credential store.

## OIDC Integration for Enterprise Authentication {#oidc-integration}

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is the foundation of enterprise authentication in Weaviate. By adopting OIDC, Weaviate eliminates the need to create isolated credential stores and instead integrates with your existing Identity Provider (IdP).

![OIDC integration](./img/oidc.png)

The security workflow with OIDC:

1.  **Delegated Authentication:** Users authenticate with your IdP, not Weaviate.
2.  **Token-Based Access:** The IdP generates a short-lived, cryptographically signed JSON Web Token (JWT).
3.  **Zero-Knowledge:** Weaviate validates the token but never sees or stores user credentials.

This architecture drastically reduces your attack surface. Even in the unlikely event of a database compromise, there are no passwords to steal, only expired or short-lived tokens that are useless on their own.

Weaviate supports any OIDC-compliant identity provider. This includes Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Auth0, Google Workspace, Keycloak, and more. This flexibility allows you to use your preferred infrastructure without vendor lock-in.

## Single Sign-On in Weaviate Cloud {#sso}

Weaviate Cloud takes OIDC integration further with native **Single Sign-On (SSO)** support, implementing a true "Bring Your Own Identity" approach.

When an employee joins your organization, they're provisioned once in your IdP and automatically gain appropriate access to Weaviate Cloud. When they leave, deprovisioning them in your IdP instantly revokes their Weaviate access across all clusters and environments.

This eliminates the operational overhead of managing separate credentials for Weaviate while ensuring that access control remains synchronized with your organization's source of truth. Users authenticate once with their corporate identity and seamlessly access Weaviate resources without additional login prompts.

## OIDC Groups: Scaling Role Management

Try managing individual permissions for 500 developers and 200 data scientists. You'll quickly realize it's not sustainable. It's tedious, error-prone, and someone will inevitably end up with the wrong access level.

**OIDC Groups** solve this by mapping your existing organizational structure directly to Weaviate roles. Your identity provider already knows who belongs to `developers`, `data-scientists`, and `analytics-team`. You can configure Weaviate to trust these group claims. When a user's group membership changes in your IdP (maybe they get promoted or switch teams), Weaviate automatically reflects this permission change on their next login.

Take a financial services company using Microsoft Entra ID. They can map their AD groups to Weaviate roles like this:

| Microsoft Entra ID Group | Weaviate Role   | Access Level              |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Engineering-Backend`    | `Maintainer`    | Read-write prod, full dev |
| `Engineering-ML`         | `DataScientist` | Read-only prod, full dev  |
| `Contractors-Eng`        | `DevOnly`       | Dev access only           |

Such a setup offers:

- **Zero-Touch Onboarding:** A new contractor is added to the AD group and immediately gains the correct Weaviate access.
- **Instant Revocation:** Removing a user from the AD group instantly revokes their specific privileges.
- **Audit Simplicity:** Auditors only need to check the IdP group membership.

## Enterprise RBAC at Scale

Beyond basic login, enterprises need sophisticated authorization policies. Weaviate's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows for granular permissions down to the collection and API level.

Let's walk through a realistic example. Say you're running an e-commerce platform using Weaviate for product search and personalization. You've got three distinct data categories (collections):

1.  **Products** – Public catalog data
2.  **CustomerBehavior** – Sensitive PII
3.  **InternalAnalytics** – Business intelligence data

![RBAC authorization with OIDC](./img/access-workflow.png)

You implement a strict "Least Privilege" model where each role gets exactly what it needs:

| Role              | Products      | CustomerBehavior | InternalAnalytics | Dev Collections |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| **Administrator** | Full CRUD     | Full CRUD        | Full CRUD         | Full CRUD       |
| **Maintainer**    | Read & Update | Read & Update    | Read & Update     | Full CRUD       |
| **DataScientist** | Read only     | Read only        | Read only         | Full CRUD       |
| **SearchApp**     | Read only     | **No Access**    | **No Access**     | **No Access**   |

- **API Security**  
Your search service authenticates as `SearchApp` and can query `Products` to serve user traffic. If an attacker compromises this API key and tries to query `CustomerBehavior`, Weaviate denies the request. The blast radius is contained.

- **Developer Safety**  
Charlie, a machine learning engineer, authenticates via Okta and receives the `DataScientist` role. Charlie can read production data to train models and has full control over dev collections. However, if Charlie accidentally runs a `DELETE` query against production, Weaviate blocks the action. No data is lost, and operations continue without interruption.

## Audit Logging and Compliance

In regulated industries, if it wasn't logged, it didn't happen. **GDPR** requires records of processing activities, **HIPAA** requires audit trails for all PHI access and **SOC 2** demands evidence of sensitive data access monitoring.

Weaviate provides comprehensive audit logging that tracks authentication events (successes and failures), RBAC checks (every permission grant or denial), role modifications (who changed permissions and when), and data access with full context on resources targeted.

Each log entry includes the timestamp, user identity, action attempted, source IP, and result. These logs are designed to be ingested by SIEM systems (like Splunk, QRadar, or Datadog) for real-time threat detection and long-term compliance archiving.

## Implementation Roadmap

Rolling out enterprise security follows a predictable lifecycle. Here is a typical path to production:

1.  **Discovery:** Map your data sensitivity levels. Identify which IdP groups map to which logical roles (Admin, Dev, Viewer).
2.  **Architecture:** Define your custom roles in Weaviate using the `authorization` configuration.
3.  **Integration:** Configure OIDC in your IdP (e.g., create the App Registration in Azure AD) and connect it to Weaviate.
4.  **Testing:** Verify that adding a user to an IdP group grants the correct permissions and that removing them revokes access.
5.  **Operations:** Configure log shipping to your SIEM and set up alerts for "Access Denied" spikes or administrative role changes.

## Conclusion

Enterprise security is about integration, not isolation. Weaviate meets enterprises where they are by integrating with existing identity providers, respecting organizational structures through OIDC groups, and providing compliance-ready audit trails.

The key enterprise security features you get are:

- **Single Sign-On** to leverage your existing IdP so users authenticate once
- **OIDC Groups** that map your org structure to access control with automatic updates
- **Granular RBAC** to implement "Least Privilege" with custom, scoped roles
- **Audit Logging** to meet compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA) with detailed logs
- **Managed Cloud** with dedicated infrastructure and SLA guarantees

You don't need to switch databases as you scale from a startup prototype to a Fortune 500 deployment. Start with basic RBAC, grow into IdP integration, and mature into full audit logging, all on the same platform.
