![Celebrating Hacktoberfest 2023 with Weaviate](./img/weaviate-hacktoberfest-2023.png)

At [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), we love open source! Join us in celebrating [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), a month-long celebration of open source!
Participants with four pull requests (PR) accepted between **October 1 - 31, 2023** will receive a unique digital reward [from Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/).


## The Task

Welcome to our demo sprint!

It is aimed at onboarding engineers and machine learning practitioners to open-source. In our [example use cases and demos](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/more-resources/example-use-cases) page, we showcase what you can do with a [vector database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database). Some of these demos have received more love than others recently, and we want to give them a little polish.

The gallery contains demos using Weaviate in different states. [Here](https://github.com/databyjp/distyll) is an example of a demo project in a good state. While some may only need a little polish of the description (README.md file), others are e.g., a little older or can use a little makeover for the user interface.

The steps to your first Hacktoberfest PR are simple:

1. Find an issue you're interested in: Go to the [example use cases and demos](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/more-resources/example-use-cases) page and select a project marked for Hacktober with a 🎃 sign. Click on “code” to get to the repository and have a look at its issues.

2. Ping us on the project’s issue, saying you're interested and which parts of the issue you would like to contribute to.
3. Open the PR as instructed in the [Weaviate Contributor Guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/contributor-guide). We will review and help you out in the process. 💚

You can also contribute by adding your own Weaviate examples. If you have other great ideas for contributions, let us know on our [Discourse](https://forum.weaviate.io/) and [Slack](https://weaviate.slack.com/) channels, and we will figure out how to highlight it in Hacktoberfest.

You don't need to be an expert to contribute to these demo projects!
