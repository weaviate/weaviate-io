## Improved Range Queries

The range index is a powerful new tool for quantitative comparisons.

Object properties in Weaviate are indexed and searchable. In earlier releases, range queries were computationally expensive. The new rangeable index is an efficient way to quickly search ranges of data. Use the new index type when you anticipate using numerical comparisons over ranges of values. When you define a property type as `int`, `number`, or `date`, consider defining a rangeable index too.

The rangeable index also works with [filterable indexes](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema/range-index#considerations). You can combine filters and range queries to quickly narrow your searches to the most relevant information.

Internally, rangeable indexes are implemented as [roaring bitmap slices](https://www.featurebase.com/blog/range-encoded-bitmaps). This is an exciting data structure that combines several clever ideas to reduce memory requirements while improving processing speeds.

## Async Replication

Data consistency is an important consideration for multi-node clusters. Weaviate v1.18 introduces a [repair-on-read](https://weaviate.io/blog/weaviate-1-18-release#repair-on-read) feature that finds and fixes problems at read time. The current release adds another powerful tool, async replication. [Async replication](/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency#async-replication) works in the background, checking and updating your data to keep it consistent.

In Weaviate, consistency has two components - schema consistency and object consistency. The [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) algorithm ensures strongly consistent schema replication. Data objects on the other hand, are eventually consistent. This means all nodes eventually contain the same data, but at a given point in time some nodes may be out of sync.

Eventual consistency is a trade-off that helps to ensure high availability, but at the risk of occasionally serving stale data.

Asynch replication addresses this risk and minimizes it. The aysnch replication mechanism uses an efficient algorithm to monitor and compare nodes within a cluster. If the algorithm identifies an inconsistency, it resyncs the data on the inconsistent node.

Async replication is much more effective than repair-on-read when there are many inconsistencies. If, for example, an offline node misses a series of updates, async replication quickly restores consistency when the node returns to service.

## Dashboards for async indexes

Weaviate gathers metrics that are compatible with the open-source [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) monitoring and alerting system. The v1.26 Weaviate release adds [new metrics](/developers/weaviate/configuration/monitoring) that monitor aysnc indexing queues.

Use these metrics with Prometheus and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/) to monitor your Weaviate instance.

If you don't see a metric that you need, you can extend Weaviate to add new metrics. To suggest a new metric, or to get started writing your own, see the [contributor guide](/developers/contributor-guide).

## Additional changes

- Starting in Helm chart version 17.0.1, constraints on module resources are commented out to improve performance. To constrain resources for specific modules, add the constraints in your `values.yaml` file.

- The HNSW `maxConnections` value is updated. Instead of 64 connections, the HNSW graph now defaults to 32 connections.

 The lower value works better with modern ANN datasets that have high dimensionality. Testing shows that the QPS/recall curves improve with lower `maxConnections` values. The best values are in the 16-32 range, depending on dataset size. To improve target recall, `ef` can be increased.

## Summary

Enjoy the new features and improvements in Weaviate `1.26`. This release is available as a docker image and is coming soon to Weaviate Cloud [WCD](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).

Thanks for reading, see you next time üëã!
