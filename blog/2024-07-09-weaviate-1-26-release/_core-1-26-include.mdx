## Additional changes

- Starting in Helm chart version 17.0.1, constraints on module resources are commented out to improve performance. To constrain resources for specific modules, add the constraints in your `values.yaml` file.

- The HNSW `maxConnections` value is updated. Instead of 64 connections, the HNSW graph now defaults to 32 connections.

 The lower value works better with modern ANN datasets that have high dimensionality. Testing shows that the QPS/recall curves improve with lower `maxConnections` values. The best values are in the 16-32 range, depending on dataset size. To improve target recall, `ef` can be increased.

## Summary

Enjoy the new features and improvements in Weaviate `1.26`. This release is available as a docker image and is coming soon to Weaviate Cloud [WCD](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).
