## Nested JSON object storage

`1.22` welcomes a new member to the Weaviate data type family, with `object` and `object[]` joining the available list.

This allows you to store nested JSON objects directly in Weaviate as a property value. In other words, you can store them without having to flatten the object or use cross-references to other Weaviate classes.

This is particularly useful for storing data that is not easily represented as a flat structure, such as an address or a product, which may itself comprise multiple properties.

An example class definition is shown below, where a `Nested` class has a `parent` property with an `object` datatype. Because the `parent` property is an `object`, it can have its own properties (`nestedProperties`), such as `child` in this example, which is a `text` datatype.

```json
{
    "class": "Nested",
    "properties": [
        {
            "dataType": ["object"],
            "name": "parent",
            "nestedProperties": [
                {
                    "dataType": ["text"],
                    "name": "child"
                }
            ],
        }
    ],
}
```

An example object of this class may look like this:

```json
{
    "parent": {"child": "I'm nested!"}
}
```

Each nested property can have its own data type, including being an `object` itself. This allows you to create nested structures of arbitrary depth.

The following class definition shows a `DoublyNested` class with a `parent` property that is an `object` datatype, similarly to above. Here, hwoever, the `child` property is itself an `object` datatype, and has its own `nestedProperties` of `childname` and `grandchild`.

```json
{
    "class": "DoublyNested",
    "properties": [
        {
            "dataType": ["object"],
            "name": "parent",
            "nestedProperties": [
                {
                    "dataType": ["object"],
                    "name": "child",
                    "nestedProperties": [
                        {
                            "dataType": ["text"],
                            "name": "childname",
                        },
                        {
                            "dataType": ["text"],
                            "name": "grandchild"
                        },
                    ],
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
}
```

An example object of this class may look like this:

```json
{
    "parent": {
        "child": {
            "childname": "Nested child",
            "granchild": "I'm doubly nested!"
        }
    }
},
```

</details>

More practically, this type of structure may be applied to capture addresses, product information, or any other nested data structure. Take a look at the following example, which shows a `Person` class with an `address` property that is an `object` datatype. The `address` property is able to store its own `nestedProperties` of `street` and `city`.

```json
{
    "class": "Person",
    "properties": [
        {
            "dataType": ["text"],
            "name": "last_name",
        },
        {
            "dataType": ["object"],
            "name": "address",
            "nestedProperties": [
                {"dataType": ["text"], "name": "street"},
                {"dataType": ["text"], "name": "city"}
            ],
        }
    ],
}
```

The user may then create an object of this class, such as:

```json
{
    "last_name": "Franklin",
    "address": {
        "city": "London",
        "street": "King Street"
    }
}
```

### Auto-schema support for nested properties

Given that the `object` data types allow nested properties of arbitrary depth, you will be pleased to know that auto-schema supports nested properties. This means that you can create a class with nested properties without having to manually define the class structure.

In other words, you can create an `object` property, and Weaviate will automatically create the nested properties for you at import time. This may allow you to create a class from a large number of nested properties with ease.

This can provide a level of convenience for experimentation or evaluation, although as always you will get the most granular and exact control over the schema by defining it manually.

:::tip Not recommended for production use
Parsing objects at import time to infer the class definition may be slow for nested properties. Accordingly, we recommend that you manually specify the nested properties in the class definition as much as possible, especially in a production setting.
:::

### Future improvements

Please keep in mind that this is the first iteration of nested JSON object storage in Weaviate, and we have further improvements planned.

In the initial implementation, any properties with `object` datatype do not affect the object vector, or the inverted index. This behavior is similar to what would happen with a cross-reference property, where the cross-referenced object is not indexed.

Future plans include the ability to index nested properties, for example to allow for filtering on nested properties and vectorization options.

## Async vector indexing (experimental)

:::caution Experimental
Given the experimental nature of this feature, we do not recommend that you use this in production.
:::

This release includes an experimental preview of our async vector indexing feature. With this, Weaviate now offers you the option de-coupling vector indexing from object creation. You can enable this to optimize imports for speed where vector indexing is not required immediately.

As of `1.22`, this is an opt-in feature. It can be enabled by setting the `ASYNC_INDEXING` setting to `true`, such as in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

In the past, the HNSW index would be built synchronously with object creation. This meant that the import process would occur in lockstep with the indexing process. The benefit of the synchronous approach is that the user can perform a search immediately after import, as the data is already indexed. However, if your only goal was fastest data ingestion, this could slow down the import process.

Starting with `1.22`, the vector indexing process can now be performed asynchronously to object creation. This means that the import process can go on independently to the indexing process and continue to create objects while the indexing process is ongoing.

The user can still perform vector searches as import progresses. Weaviate will search the vector index built to date as well as up to 100,000 un-indexed objects using brute force.

### Updated `nodes` endpoint

The `nodes` REST endpoint has been updated to reflect this change.

`INDEXING` has been added to the list of available node statuses, and the `stats` field now includes an `vectorQueueLength` field, which contains the number of objects currently being indexed.

## Additional gRPC support

The team continues to add gRPC support under the hood, with a big part of the equivalent GraphQL `Get` queries, and batch import functionality now available via gRPC.

With these changes, we have seen improvements in import speeds of around ~60-80% for batch imports, and multiple times faster `Get` queries. A big part of this comes from the fact that gRPC is a binary protocol, which is more efficient than the text-based GraphQL protocol, as well as it being based on HTTP/2.

:::note gRPC is still experimental / API changes

Please keep in mind that gRPC is still experimental, and we do not recommend that you use it in production.

The gRPC implementation is still evolving as we will continue to add more functionality to it. This release, for example, changes the implementation under the hood. If you were trying out gRPC in the past, this version may not be compatible with your existing code.

:::

## New Python client API

If you are wondering how to use the new gRPC functionality, we have you covered with the new Python client. This client is a pre-release version with not only gRPC support but also an improved API. The new API is more Pythonic, with a focus on improving the user/developer experience through custom classes and methods, which will trigger IDE auto-completion in place of untyped dictionaries.

As one example, a class creation requests that used to look like:

```python
# Existing (v3) Python client syntax
class_obj = {
    "class": "Question",
    "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai",
    "moduleConfig": {
        "generative-openai": {}
    }
}

client.schema.create_class(class_obj)
```

Now looks like:

```python
# Proposed (v4) Python client syntax
client.collection.create(
    name="Question",
    vectorizer_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(),
    generative_config=wvc.ConfigFactory.Generative.openai()
)
```

And a `near text` query like the following:

```python
# Existing (v3) Python client syntax
response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question", ["question", "answer", "category"])
    .with_near_text({"concepts": ["biology"]})
    .with_limit(2)
    .do()
)
```

Now looks like:

```python
# Proposed (v4) Python client syntax
questions = client.collection.get("Question")
questions.query.near_text(query="biology", limit=2)
```

You may already have seen [a blog post](../2023-09-26-collections-python-client/index.mdx) and [a documentation page](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/experimental) about this new client. If you have yet to try it out, we encourage you to do so!

This is a pre-release version, so we would love to hear your feedback on the new API. Please try it and let us know what you think through this [feedback form](https://tally.so/r/wa4NDB). We will use your feedback to improve the API before the official release.

## Summary

That's it from us - we hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in Weaviate `1.22`. This release is already available on [WCS](https://console.weaviate.cloud/). So you can try it out yourself on a free sandbox, or by upgrading!

Thanks for reading, and see you next time 👋!
