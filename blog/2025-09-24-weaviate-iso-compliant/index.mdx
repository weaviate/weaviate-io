ðŸ’« Introduction

At Weaviate, we take the protection of your data seriously. Our information security measures continuously evolve and adapt to threats we see out there in the wilds of the internet. Today we are proud to announce that we have been certified as compliant with the ISO 27001:2022 standard for Information Security Management. 

## What is ISO 27001?

ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It requires organizations to systematically manage information security risks through continuous monitoring, regular risk assessments, and implementation of appropriate security controls. The certification process involves rigorous third-party audits that evaluate our security policies, procedures, and technical controls to ensure they meet the highest international standards

## Building Customer Trust

This certification demonstrates our commitment to protecting your data with enterprise-grade security measures. For our customers evaluating Weaviate for production deployments, ISO 27001 certification provides independent verification that our security practices meet global standards and regulatory requirements. It's particularly valuable for customers in regulated industries who need documented evidence of robust security controls.
