<!-- truncate -->
1. **AutoPQ** - Weaviate now automatically triggers the use of Product Quantization (PQ) for vector indexing. This improves the developer experience for switching on PQ. We've also added auto `segment` size setting.
2. **Flat indexing + Binary Quantization** - Weaviate now supports another (`flat`) vector index type, with optional binary quantization. This is particularly useful for multi-tenancy use cases.
3. **OSS LLM support through Anyscale** - Weaviate now supports open-source large language models such as Llama2-70b, CodeLlama-34b or Mistral-7B-Instruct.
4. **Performance improvements** - We improved mean time to recovery (MMTR)) for Weaviate by changing the way shards are loaded. We also added automatic resource limiting to prevent out-of-memory errors.
5. **Minor changes** - The `nodes` endpoint has been updated with a new `minimal` output default for those of you with many shards/tenants.

:::tip Available on WCS

## AutoPQ

## Flat indexing + Binary Quantization

## OSS LLM support (`generative-anyscale` module)

## Performance improvements
[Lazy shard loading](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#lazy-shard-loading) allows you to start working with your data sooner. After a restart, shards load in the background. If the shard you want to query is already loaded, you can get your results right away. If the shard is not loaded yet, Weaviate prioritizes loading that shard and returns a response when it is ready.

## Minor changes

## Summary

That's all from us - we hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in Weaviate `1.23`. This release is already available on [WCS](https://console.weaviate.cloud/). So you can try it out yourself on a free sandbox, or by upgrading!
