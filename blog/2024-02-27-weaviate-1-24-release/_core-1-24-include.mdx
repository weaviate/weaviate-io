<!-- truncate -->
1. **AutoPQ** - Weaviate now automatically triggers the use of Product Quantization (PQ) for vector indexing. This improves the developer experience for switching on PQ. We've also added auto `segment` size setting.
1. **Flat vector index + Binary Quantization** - New index type for small collections, such as for multi-tenancy use cases.
1. **`generative-anyscale`** - Adds open-source large language model integration.
1. **Performance improvements** - Mean time to recovery (MMTR) is reduced and automatic resource limiting prevents out-of-memory errors.
1. **Python client beta update** - Adds `1.23` support and new features.
1. **Minor changes** - The `nodes` endpoint adds a new `minimal` output default.

index is a single layer of disk-based references to the object vectors. It therefore has a correspondingly small size and minimal memory footprint.

Binary quantization (BQ) compression is available for the `flat` index type to speed up vector search.
