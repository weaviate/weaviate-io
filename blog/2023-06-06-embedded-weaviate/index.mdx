Yes, 10 Python lines of code, generously formatted with whitespace. Or 14 for TypeScript. Oh, and all your data stays private locally, and we don't charge you anything. We're also going to build a useful example, illustrating a testing scenario. Here's how.

## 1. Install the client library

The Python and TypeScript client libraries support running Weaviate embedded on Linux, and starting with versions 3.21.0 and 1.2.0 respectively, on macOS as well.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```bash
  pip install weaviate-client  --upgrade
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">

  ```bash
  npm install weaviate-ts-embedded typescript ts-node jest  # also install support for TypeScript and Jest testing
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 2. Run the code

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  Save as `embedded.py` and run `python embedded.py`:
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PyCode}
    startMarker="# START 10lines"
    endMarker="# END 10lines"
    language="py"
  />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">

  Save as `embedded.ts` and run `node --loader=ts-node/esm embedded.ts`:
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={TSCode}
    startMarker="// START 10lines"
    endMarker="// END 10lines"
    language="js"
  />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> How does this work?

Essentially, what happens behind the scenes is that the client library downloads the server binary, spawns it in a separate process, connects to it, then terminates it on exit. The data is persisted, so you can use it from future invocations, or you can [transfer it to another instance](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects/#restore-to-a-target-instance).

You can learn more about running Weaviate locally from client code on the [Embedded Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded/) page.


## <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Use cases

What can you do with Embedded Weaviate? Quite a few things!

First off, you can get started very quickly with Weaviate on your local machine, without having to explicitly download, install or instantiate a server.


### Jupyter notebooks

You can also use Embedded Weaviate from Jupyter notebooks, including on Google Colaboratory. Here is the example above as [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XAJc9OvkKhsJRmheqWZmjYU707dqEIl8?usp=sharing).

### Use Weaviate in CI/CD pipelines

You can use Embedded Weaviate in automated tests, where you can run integration tests without having to manage a separate server instance. Here is the example above slightly modified to perform similarity search and test that the added object was found.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  Save as `embedded_test.py` and run `pytest`. (If you don't have pytest, run `pip install pytest`.)
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PyCode}
    startMarker="# START TestExample"
    endMarker="# END TestExample"
    language="py"
  />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">

  Save as `embedded_test.ts` and run `npx jest`:
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={TSCode}
    startMarker="// START TestExample"
    endMarker="// END TestExample"
    language="js"
  />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
