Yes, 10 Python lines of code, generously formatted with whitespace. Or 14 for TypeScript. Oh, and all your data stays private locally, and we don't charge you anything. We're also going to build a useful example, illustrating a testing scenario. Here's how.

:::info macOS support
Embedded DB support for macOS is in the works (you can track progress in [this issue](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client/issues/239)).

<details>
  <summary>Running Embedded DB on macOS right now</summary>

   You can use a Linux Docker image to follow along, for example if you want to dry-run a CI/CD pipeline. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), then run this command to land in a bash Linux prompt:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```shell
  docker run -it --name wembed -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python /bin/bash
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

  ```shell
  docker run -it --name wembed -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp node /bin/bash
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  This will create a Docker container named `wembed` and will map your current directory to `/usr/src/myapp` in the container. From then on, the remaining steps will be the same.

## 1. Install the client library

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```bash
  pip install weaviate-client
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

  ```bash
  npm install weaviate-ts-embedded ts-node jest  # also install support for TypeScript and Jest testing
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 2. Run the code

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  Save as `embedded.py` and run `python embedded.py`:
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PyCode}
    startMarker="# START 10lines"
    endMarker="# END 10lines"
    language="py"
  />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

  Save as `embedded.ts` and run `node --loader=ts-node/esm embedded.ts`:
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={TSCode}
    startMarker="// START 10lines"
    endMarker="// END 10lines"
    language="js"
  />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> How does this work?

Essentially, what happens behind the scenes is that the client library downloads the server binary, spawns it in a separate process, connects to it, then terminates it on exit. The data is persisted, so you can use it from future invocations, or you can [transfer it to another instance](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects/#restore-to-a-target-instance).

You can learn more about running Weaviate locally from client code on the [Embedded Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded/) page.


## <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Use cases

What can you do with Embedded Weaviate? Quite a few things!

First off, you can get started very quickly with Weaviate on your local machine, without having to explicitly download, install or instantiate a server.


### Jupyter notebooks

You can also use Embedded Weaviate from Jupyter notebooks, including on Google Colaboratory. Here is the example above as [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XAJc9OvkKhsJRmheqWZmjYU707dqEIl8?usp=sharing).

### Use Weaviate in CI/CD pipelines

You can use Embedded Weaviate in automated tests, where you can run integration tests without having to manage a separate server instance. Here is the example above slightly modified to perform similarity search and test that the added object was found.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  Save as `embedded_test.py` and run `pytest`. (If you don't have pytest, run `pip install pytest`.)
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PyCode}
    startMarker="# START TestExample"
    endMarker="# END TestExample"
    language="py"
  />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

  Save as `embedded_test.ts` and run `npx jest`:
  <br/>

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={TSCode}
    startMarker="// START TestExample"
    endMarker="// END TestExample"
    language="js"
  />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
