### OG image generator

OG images for documentation are created and linked automatically. The `og` tag in 
front matter should only be used for manual override. E.g. The `architecture/binary_passage_retrieval.md` image
would be located at `img/og/og-documentation/architecture-binary-passage-retrieval.jpg`.

## Installing & Running with Docker

### Build the docker image

For cache-friendliness the `Dockerfile` is designed to copy the dependency
files first, so that changing any content only requires minimal rebuilding of
the image.

```
docker build -t weaviate-io .
```

### Run the docker image with live reload

The following is an example to run the image with live-reload enabled for the
`developers` folder. You can also mount different folders in the same way:

```
docker run -v $PWD/developers:/weaviate-io/developers -p 4000:4000 -p 35729:35279 -it weaviate-io
```
