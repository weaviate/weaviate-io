The Weaviate TypeScript client supports TypeScript and JavaScript. The TypeScript client v3 is currently in beta.

The upcoming v3 client currently supports server side development (Node.js hosted). See [v3 packages](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/v2_v3_migration#node-support-only) for details. If your application is browser based, consider using the TypeScript client v2.
