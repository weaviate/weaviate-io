The client uses a keep-alive header to maintain long-lived connections to Weaviate.

After you establish the connection to your Weaviate instance, subsequent calls are faster. When you finish your client operations, close the connection to free server resources.

Use the `client.close()` method to close the connection instead of waiting for the connection to time out.
