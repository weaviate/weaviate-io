It's a big, reddish-brown organ located in our tummy, on the right side, just under our ribs. \n\nThe liver has many important jobs. One of its main jobs is to clean our blood. It acts like a filter, removing all the bad stuff that can make us sick, like toxins and waste products. It also helps break down the food we eat into smaller pieces so our body can use it for energy. \n\nAnother cool thing about the liver is that it stores important nutrients, like vitamins and minerals, so our body can use them when we need them. It's like a little storage room for our body! \n\nThe liver is also responsible for making a special liquid called bile, which helps our body digest fats. It's like a helper that breaks down the fats into tiny pieces so our body can absorb them easily. \n\nSo, you can think of the liver as a hardworking superhero that keeps our body clean, helps us get energy from food, stores important nutrients, and helps us digest fats. It's a very important organ that we should take good care of!"
