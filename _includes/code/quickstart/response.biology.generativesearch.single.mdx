It's really amazing because it's what makes you unique and special."

They have the same kind of body parts, like legs or wings, and they can have babies with other members of their species. For example, dogs are a species, and so are cats. They look different and act differently, but all dogs can have puppies with other dogs, and all cats can have kittens with other cats. So, a species is like a big family of animals or plants that are all related to each other in a special way."
