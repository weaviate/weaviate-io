When you import unvectorized data, the import process normally includes a vectorization step. Some third party vectorization services provide APIs that accept objects in batches. When a batch API is available, Weaviate automatically submits incoming objects in batches. Weaviate also adjusts the batch submission rate to minimize problems with rate limits on third party APIs.

In addition to significantly improved import times, submitting objects in batches makes more efficient use of API tokens.

There are some limitations.

- **Rate limits**. Some third party APIs have different limits for trial (free) tiers and subscription (paid) tiers. If you have a trial API key, you may need to manually set a rate limit in the Weaviate client.
- **No batch API**. PaLM does not offer a batch API.
- **Batch submission not implemented**. This feature is not yet available for all APIs.
