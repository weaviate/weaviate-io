Some [model providers](/developers/weaviate/model-providers/index.md) provide batch vectorization APIs, where each request can include multiple objects. From Weaviate `v1.25.0`, a batch import into Weaviate can make use of these APIs.

This reduces the number of requests to the model provider, improving throughput. Some providers may also offer a discount for batch requests.

Please refer to the specific model provider documentation for details.
