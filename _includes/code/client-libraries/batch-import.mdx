Some [model providers](/developers/weaviate/model-providers/index.md) provide batch vectorization APIs, where each request can include multiple objects.

From Weaviate `v1.25.0`, a batch import automatically makes use of the model providers' batch vectorization APIs where available. This reduces the number of requests to the model provider, improving throughput. Some providers may also offer a discount for batch requests.

Please refer to the individual model provider's documentation for details on up-to-date pricing and availability of batch vectorization APIs.
