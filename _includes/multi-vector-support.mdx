Starting in v1.24.0, Weaviate adds support for multi-vector objects. When you define a collection, you can specify can have more than one vector. Each vector is independent. Each vector can have its own index, its own compression, and its own vectorizer. You do not have to declare multiple vectors, but if you do, you need to adjust your queries to specify which vector you want to use.
