:::note Sandbox expiry
The sandbox is free, but it will expire after 30 days. After this time, all data in the sandbox will be deleted.

If you would like to preserve your sandbox data, you can retrieve your data with our [cursor API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects#exhaustive-retrieval-after), or [contact us to upgrade](/pricing#register) to a production SaaS product (in private beta at the time of writing).
