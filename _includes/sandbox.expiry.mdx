:::note Sandbox expiration
The sandbox is free, but it will expire after 14 days. After this time, all data in the sandbox will be deleted.

If you would like to preserve your sandbox data, you can [retrieve your data](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects), or [contact us to upgrade](/pricing) to a production SaaS instance.
