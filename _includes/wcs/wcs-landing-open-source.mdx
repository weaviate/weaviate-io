Weaviate is more than just a vector database. Weaviate is a scalable, flexible platform. The core, [open-source project](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) offers vector search, keyword, and hybrid search. It has a pluggable architecture to connect with ML models and tools to help you build scalable AI applications.

Weaviate Cloud is built on Weaviate core. They share the same technology and offer the same great features. In addition, Weaviate Cloud handles the work of hosting your Weaviate instance. This gets you up and running fast and lets you focus on your application. Weaviate Cloud takes care of the operational details, so you don't have to.

These pages document the Weaviate Cloud user interface (UI) and specific operational features. For information about the Weaviate database, client APIs, third-party modules, and other features, see the [Weaviate documentation site](/developers/weaviate).
