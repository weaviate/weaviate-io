Weaviate is more than just a vector database. Weaviate is a scalable, flexible platform. The core, [open source project](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) offers vector search, keyword, and hybrid search. It has a plugable architecture to connect with ML models and tools to help you build scalable AI applications.

WCD is built on Weaviate core. They share the same technology, and offer the same great features. In addition, WCD handles the work of hosting your Weaviate instance. This gets you up and running fast and lets you focus on your application. WCD takes care of the operational details so you don't have to.

These pages document the WCD user interface (UI) and WCD specific operational features. For information about the Weaviate database, client APIs, third-party modules, and other features, see the [Weaviate documentation site](/developers/weaviate).
