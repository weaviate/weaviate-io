WCS does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate core is released. 

The WCS console shows an "Update!" button on the details panel when a newer version is available. Consider your business needs, and [upgrade your cluster](/developers/wcs/platform/version) when you have a suitable maintenance window.
