To export your data, iterate through each of your collections. For each collection, iterate through the objects in the collection and export them one by one. The process to iterate through collection objects depends on how your objects are configured. For details, see [Read all objects](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects).

The [cursor API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects#exhaustive-listing-using-a-cursor-after) provides another way to export your data.
