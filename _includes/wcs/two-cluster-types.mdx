[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) provides two instance types.

 - Sandbox clusters. Sandbox clusters are small, free clusters designed for learning and experimentation. Sandbox clusters not scalable and expire after 14 days.
 - Serverless clusters. Serverless clusters are robust, paid clusters designed for production use. Manage clusters scale to meet your needs and don't expire.
