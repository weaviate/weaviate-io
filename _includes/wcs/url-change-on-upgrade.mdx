Problem: gRPC errors after updating a managed cluster. 

```
weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateGRPCUnavailableError: gRPC health check could not be completed.
```

Solution: Verify the cluster URL is correct and update the URL if needed.

When a managed cluster is updated, the cluster URL may change slightly. WCS still routes the old URL, so some connections work, however the new gRPC and the old HTTP URLS are different so connections that require gRCP fail.

To check the URLs, open the WCS Console and check the details panel for your cluster. If you prefix Cluster URL with `grpc-`, the Cluster URL and the Cluster gRPC URL should match.

Compare the Cluster URL with the connection URL in your application. If they are different, update the application to use the new Cluster URL.
