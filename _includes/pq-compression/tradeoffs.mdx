PQ makes tradeoffs between recall, performance, and memory usage. This means a PQ configuration that reduces memory may also reduce recall. There are similar trade-offs when you use HNSW without PQ. If you use PQ compression, you should also tune HNSW so that they compliment each other. For more information about how to configure HNSW, see [Configuration: Indexes](../configuration/indexes.md) .
