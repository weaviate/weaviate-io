PQ makes tradeoffs between recall, performance, and memory usage. This means a PQ configuration that reduces memory may also reduce recall. There are similar trade-offs when you use HNSW without PQ. If you use PQ compression, you should also tune HNSW so that they compliment each other. 

To configure HNSW, see [Configuration: Indexes](/developers/weaviate/configuration/indexes) .
