[Product quantization (PQ)](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#hnsw-with-product-quantizationpq) is a form of data compression for vectors. PQ reduces the memory footprint of a vector index, so enabling PQ for HNSW lets you work with larger datasets. For a discussion of how PQ saves memory, see [this page](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#product-quantization).
