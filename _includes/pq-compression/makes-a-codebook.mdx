PQ relies on a codebook to compress the original vectors. The codebook defines "centroids" that are used to calculate the compressed vector. If you are not using [AutoPQ](/developers/weaviate/configuration/pq-compression#configure-autopq), you must have some vectors loaded before you enable PQ so Weaviate can define the centroids. The should have from 10,000 to 100,000 vectors loaded before you enable PQ.
