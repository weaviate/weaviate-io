:::note
Starting in v1.24, collections support multiple named vectors.
:::

Collections can have multiple [named vectors](/weaviate/config-refs/schema/multi-vector). The vectors in a collection can have their own configurations, and compression must be enabled independently for each vector. The procedure varies slightly by client language, but in each case the idea is the same.

Every vector is independent and can use [PQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/pq-compression.md), [BQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/bq-compression.md), [SQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/sq-compression), or no compression.
