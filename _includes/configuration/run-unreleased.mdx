:::warning Unreleased software
DISCLAIMER: Release candidate images and other unreleased software are not supported.

Unreleased software and images may contain bugs. APIs may change. Features under development may be withdrawn or modified. Do not use unreleased software in production.

:::

To run an unreleased version of Weaviate, edit your configuration file to use the unreleased image instead of a generally available image. The [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/releases/) lists generally available and release candidate builds.

For example, to run a Docker image for a release candidate, edit your `docker-config.yaml` to import the release candidate image. 

```yml
image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.23.0-rc.1
```
