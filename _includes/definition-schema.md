Weaviate's schema defines its data structure in a formal language. In other words, it is a blueprint of how to organize and store the data.

The schema defines data classes (i.e. collections of objects), the properties within each class (name, type, description, settings), possible graph links between data objects ([cross-references](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#cross-references)), and the vectorizer module (if any) to be used for the class, as well as settings such as the vectorizer module, and index configurations.
