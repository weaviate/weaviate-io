Weaviate's schema defines its data structure in a formal language. In other words, it is a blueprint of how the data is to be organized and stored. The schema defines schema-level settings (e.g. the vectorizer module), the properties within each class (name, type, description, settings), possible graph links between data objects (cross-references), and the vectorizer module (if any) to be used for the class.
