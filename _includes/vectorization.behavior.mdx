Weaviate generates vector embeddings at the object level (rather than for individual properties). For instance `text2vec-*` modules can generate vectors from text objects. To produce the string to be vectorized from each object, Weaviate follows the schema configuration for the relevant class.

Unless specified otherwise in the schema, the default behavior is to:

- Only vectorize properties that use the `text` data type (unless [skip](/developers/weaviate/configuration/schema-configuration#property-level-module-settings)ped)
- Sort properties in alphabetical (a-z) order before concatenating values
- If `vectorizePropertyName` is `true` (`false` by default) prepend the property name to each property value
- Join the (prepended) property values with spaces
- Prepend the class name (unless `vectorizeClassName` is `false`)
- Convert the produced string to lowercase
