You can use `text2vec` modules with Weaviate to generate vector data each object. To produce the string to be vectorized, Weaviate follows schema configuration for the relevant class.

Unless specified otherwise, the default behavior is to:

- Only vectorize properties that use the `text` data type
- Sort properties in alphabetical (a-z) order before concatenating values
- Prepend the class name to the value
- Join properties with spaces, and
- Convert the produced string to lowercase
