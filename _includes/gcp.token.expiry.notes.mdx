By default, Google Cloud's OAuth 2.0 access tokens have a lifetime of 1 hour. You can create tokens that last up to 12 hours. To create longer lasting tokens, follow the [instructions in the Google Cloud IAM Guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/create-short-lived-credentials-direct#rest_2).

Since the OAuth token is only valid for a limited time, you **must** periodically replace the token with a new one. After you generate the new token, you have to re-instantiate your Weaviate client to use it.

You can update the OAuth token manually, but manual updates may not be appropriate for your use case.

You can also automate the OAth token update. Automating this procedure is a complex process that is outside our control. However, here are some automation options:

<details>
  <summary>With Google Cloud CLI</summary>

If you are using the Google Cloud CLI, you could run this through your preferred programming language, and extract the results.<p><br/></p>

For example, you could periodically run:

```python
client = re_instantiate_weaviate()
```

Where `re_instantiate_weaviate` is something like:

```python
import subprocess
import weaviate

def refresh_token() -> str:
    result = subprocess.run(["gcloud", "auth", "print-access-token"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f"Error refreshing token: {result.stderr}")
        return None
    return result.stdout.strip()

def re_instantiate_weaviate() -> weaviate.Client:
    token = refresh_token()

    client = weaviate.Client(
      url = "https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network",  # Replace with your Weaviate URL
      additional_headers = {
        "X-PaLM-Api-Key": token,
      }
    )
    return client

# Run this every ~60 minutes
client = re_instantiate_weaviate()
```

  <summary>With <code>google-auth</code></summary>

Another way is through Google's own authentication library `google-auth`.<p><br/></p>

See the links to `google-auth` in [Python](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) and [Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/google-auth-library/latest) libraries.<p><br/></p>

You can, then, periodically the `refresh` function ([see Python docs](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.oauth2.service_account.html#google.oauth2.service_account.Credentials.refresh)) to obtain a renewed token, and re-instantiate the Weaviate client.

For example, you could periodically run:

```python
client = re_instantiate_weaviate()
```

Where `re_instantiate_weaviate` is something like:

```python
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials
import weaviate
import os


def get_credentials() -> Credentials:
    credentials = Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        "path/to/your/service-account.json",
        scopes=[
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language",
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform",
        ],
    )
    request = Request()
    credentials.refresh(request)
    return credentials


def re_instantiate_weaviate() -> weaviate.Client:
    credentials = get_credentials()
    token = credentials.token

    client = weaviate.connect_to_wcs(  # e.g. if you use the Weaviate Cloud Service
        cluster_url="https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network",  # Replace with your WCS URL
        auth_credentials=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(os.getenv("WCS_DEMO_RO_KEY")),  # Replace with your WCS key
        headers={
            "X-PaLM-Api-Key": token,
        },
    )
    return client


# Run this every ~60 minutes
client = re_instantiate_weaviate()
```

The service account key shown above can be generated by following [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete).
