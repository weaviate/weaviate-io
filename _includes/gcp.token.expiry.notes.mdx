Google Cloud's OAuth 2.0 access tokens are configured to have a standard lifetime of 1 hour.

Therefore, you **must** periodically replace the token with a valid one and supply it to Weaviate by re-instantiating the client with the new key.

You can do this manually.

Automating this is a complex, advanced process that is outside the scope of our control. However, here are a couple of possible options for doing so:

<details>
  <summary>With Google Cloud CLI</summary>

If you are using the Google Cloud CLI, you could run this through your preferred programming language, and extract the results.<p><br/></p>

For example, you could periodically run:

```python
client = re_instantiate_weaviate()
```

Where `re_instantiate_weaviate` is something like:

```python
import subprocess
import time
import weaviate

def refresh_token():
    result = subprocess.run(["gcloud", "auth", "print-access-token"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f"Error refreshing token: {result.stderr}")
        return None
    return result.stdout.strip()

# Run this every ~60 minutes
def re_instantiate_weaviate():
    token = refresh_token()
    print(f"Refreshed token: {token}")

    client = weaviate.Client(
      url = "https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/",
      additional_headers = {
        "X-Palm-Api-Key": token,
      }
    )
    return client
```

  <summary>With <code>google-auth</code></summary>

Another way is through Google's own authentication library `google-auth`.<p><br/></p>

See the links to `google-auth` in [Python](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) and [Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/google-auth-library/latest) libraries.<p><br/></p>

You can, then, periodically the `refresh` function ([see Python docs](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.oauth2.service_account.html#google.oauth2.service_account.Credentials.refresh)) to obtain a renewed token, and re-instantiate the Weaviate client.

For example, you could periodically run:

```python
client = re_instantiate_weaviate()
```

Where `re_instantiate_weaviate` is something like:

```python
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials
import time

def get_credentials():
    credentials = Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/your/service-account.json')
    credentials.refresh(Request())
    return credentials

# Run this every ~60 minutes
def re_instantiate_weaviate():
    credentials = def get_credentials():
    token = credentials.token

    client = weaviate.Client(
      url = "https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/",
      additional_headers = {
        "X-Palm-Api-Key": token,
      }
    )
    return client
```
