:::info Dynamic index requires `ASYNC_INDEXING`
To use the `dynamic` vector index type, your Weaviate instance must have the `ASYNC_INDEXING` [environment variable](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars#general) enabled. This can be done by setting the `ASYNC_INDEXING` environment variable to `true`. For Weaviate Cloud users, this can be enabled through the Weaviate Cloud dashboard.
