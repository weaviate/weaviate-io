:::info Dynamic index requires `ASYNC_INDEXING`
Dynamic indexes require asynchronous indexing. To enable asynchronous indexing in a self-hosted Weaviate instance, set the `ASYNC_INDEXING` [environment variable](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars#general) to `true`. If your instance is hosted in Weaviate Cloud, use the  Weaviate Cloud console to enable asynchronous indexing.
