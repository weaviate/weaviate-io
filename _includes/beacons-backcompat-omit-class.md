:::note
For backward compatibility, you can omit the class name in the beacon
format and specify it as `weaviate://localhost/<id>`. This is, however,
considered deprecated and will be removed with a future release, as duplicate
IDs across classes could mean that this beacon is not uniquely identifiable.
