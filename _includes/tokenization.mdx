Weaviate converts filter terms into tokens. The default tokenization is `word`. The `word` tokenizer keeps alphanumeric characters, lowercase them and splits on whitespace. It converts a string like "Test_domain_weaviate" into "test", "domain", and "weaviate".

For details and additional tokenization methods, see [Tokenization](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema#tokenization).
