:::caution
This flow authenticates users using their *username* and *password*.

The username or password are not saved in the Weaviate client. They are only used to obtain the first tokens, after which existing tokens will be used to obtain subsequent tokens if possible.

Nonetheless, this authentication flow should only be used on trusted devices. 
:::

Not every provider automatically includes a `refresh token` and an appropriate *scope* might be required that depends on your identity provider. The client uses *offline_access* as default scope which works with some providers.

Without a refresh token, there is no possibility to acquire a new `access token` and the client becomes unauthenticated after expiration.
