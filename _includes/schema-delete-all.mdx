:::caution Resetting your Weaviate instance
If your Weaviate instance contains data where you would like it to be empty, you can reset your instance, or you can manually delete the schema.

**But beware that will also delete all associated objects!** 

Do not do this to a production database, or anywhere where you do not wish to delete your data. 

Run this Python code to reset your instance and get an output confirming it;

```python
import weaviate
import json

client = weaviate.Client("https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/")  # Replace with your endpoint

# delete all classes - THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA IN YOUR INSTANCE
client.schema.delete_all()

schema = client.schema.get()
print(json.dumps(schema, indent=4))
```
