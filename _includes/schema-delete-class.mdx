You can delete any unwanted collection(s), along with the data that they contain.

:::caution Deleting a collection also deletes its objects
When you **delete a collection, you delete all associated objects**!

Be very careful with deletes on a production database and anywhere else that you have important data.
:::

This code deletes a collection and its objects.
