Embedded Weaviate is a new deployment model that runs a Weaviate instance from your application code rather than from a stand-alone Weaviate server installation.

When Embedded Weaviate starts for the first time, it creates a permanent datastore in the location set in your `persistence_data_path`. When your client exits, the Embedded Weaviate instance also exits, but the data persists . The next time the client runs, it starts a new instance of Embedded Weaviate. New Embedded Weaviate instances use the data that is saved in the datastore.
