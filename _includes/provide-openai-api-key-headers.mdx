The API key can be provided to Weaviate as an environment variable, or in the HTTP header with every request. Here, we will add it to the Weaviate client at instantiation as shown below. The client will then send the key as a part of the HTTP request header with every request.

:::tip Running GraphQL OpenAI queries against local Docker instances
You can explore data in a self-hosted Weaviate instance using [Weaviate's GraphQL interface](https://console.weaviate.io) by connecting to its endpoint, such as `localhost:8080`. If you get an error about a missing OpenAI key (e.g. when running a `nearText` query), you can supply the OpenAI API key by exporting it via the `OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable before running `docker-compose up`.
