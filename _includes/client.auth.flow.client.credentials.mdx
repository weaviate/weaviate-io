To authenticate a client secret most identity providers require a *scope* to be specified. This *scope* depends on the configuration of the identity providers, so we ask you to refer to the identity provider's documentation.

Most providers do not include a refresh token in their response so `client secret` is saved in the client to obtain a new `access token` on expiration of the existing one.
