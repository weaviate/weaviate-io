Any other authentication method can be used to obtain tokens directly from your identity provider, for example by using this step-by-step guide of the [hybrid flow](../configuration/authentication.html).

If no `refresh token` is provided, there is no possibility to obtain a new `access token` and the client becomes unauthenticated after expiration.
