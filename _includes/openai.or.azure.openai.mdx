### Azure OpenAI or OpenAI?

:::tip
This module is compatible with both **OpenAI** and **Azure OpenAI**.
:::

The instructions vary slightly based on whether you are using OpenAI directly or Azure OpenAI. Please make sure that you are following the right instructions for your service provider.

The differences are in:
- How to set your model (in the schema), and
- How to provide the API key (can be done through the configuration file or at runtime)
