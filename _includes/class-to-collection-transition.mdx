Weaviate client APIs are transitioning from the "class" model to a "collection" model. The new [Python Client (v4)](/blog/collections-python-client-preview) is the first client to use the new model. Expect to see differences in terminology, descriptions, and [output formats](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#print-formatting) during the transition period.
