With these clients you can perform *all* RESTful and GraphQL requests. This means you can use any endpoint, and perform all GraphQL queries directly from your Python, JS, Java or Go scripts!

How to use these clients for RESTful API requests and GraphQL queries, code snippets are included in the code blocks on the dedicated [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/) and [GraphQL](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/) reference pages. The methods of the clients are designed to reflect the API functions 1-1, but are designed (structured and named) in the way native to the language.
