With these clients you can perform *all* RESTful and GraphQL requests. This means you can use any endpoint, and perform all GraphQL queries directly from your Python, TypeScript, Java or Go scripts.

The Weaviate documentation, including the [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/) and [GraphQL](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/) reference pages include code snippets using each client. The methods of the clients are designed to reflect the API functions 1-1, but are designed (structured and named) in the way native to the language.
