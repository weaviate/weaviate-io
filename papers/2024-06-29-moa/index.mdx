## Can we combine multiple smaller open-source LLMs and get them to outperform larger monolithic LLMs?

## Overview:

- This paper identifies the concept of **collaborativeness**: LLMs tend to generate better responses when presented with outputs from other even less capable models.

- They use this to build a Mixture of Agents(MoA) architechture where multiple LLMs are used to iteratively enhance the generation quality.

- LLMs in deeper layers are presented responses from LLMs in earlier layers and iteratively improve the response; mitigates individual model deficiencies and enhance overall response.

## MoA Architechture

The complete architechture consists of LLM agents playing one of two roles:

1. Proposers: These models generate initial reference responses.

2. Aggregators: These models synthesize the different responses from the proposers into one high-quality response.

- Models used: `Qwen1.5-110B-Chat`, `Qwen1.572B-Chat`, `WizardLM-8x22B`, `LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct`, `Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1`, `dbrx-instruct`

- 3 MoA layers and use the same set of models in each MoA layer

- `Qwen1.5-110BChat` as the aggregator in the last layer

- Some models work better as proposers and others as both proposers and aggregators.

## How do you choose which models to include in the MoA??

Two metrics are used to assess which models are included in the mixture:

- Performance: The average win rate of models in layer i decides if they are included in layer i + 1.

- Diversity: The diversity of model outputs is important - using heterogeneous models across layers is better then using the same model

## Details:

- MoA achieves a new SOTA win rate of 65.8% on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to the previous best of 57.5% achieved by GPT-4 Omni. 

- Overall performance comparable to GPT-4 Turbo while being 2× more cost-effective.

- No finetuning required only utilizes the interface of prompting and generation of LLMs.

- Extends the MoE concept to the model level by operating at the model level rather than at the activation level.

- You can swap the final aggregator to any LLM of your choice (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude3.5) and this imrpoves performance!
