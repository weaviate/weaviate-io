Anthropic was able to solve the "lost in the middle" problem "by adding the sentence ‚ÄúHere is the most relevant sentence in the context:‚Äù to the start of Claude‚Äôs response. This was enough to raise Claude 2.1‚Äôs score from 27% to 98% on the original evaluation."

Does it just take a little bit of prompt engineering to solve low accuracy when needing to retrieve from the middle of a context window??
