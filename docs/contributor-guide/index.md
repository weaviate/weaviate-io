# Welcome

üéâ First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! üéâ

## Contributor Guide Structure

We recommend reading through the [Contributors' getting started guide](./getting-started/index.md) first. That includes suggestions on different ways to contribute, as well as how you can make those contributions.

This guide also includes the following sections on specific areas. You can think of these as more technical, reference guides on each area for contributors.
- [Weaviate Core](./weaviate-core/index.md)
- [Weaviate Modules](./weaviate-modules/index.md)
- [Contextionary](./contextionary/index.md)
- [Weaviate Clients](./weaviate-clients/index.md)
