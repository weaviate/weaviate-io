## Intro to index settings

You can configure indices in Weaviate per class. Weaviate supports two types of indices.

1. An **approximate nearest neighbor index (ANN)** - the ANN index is used to serve all vector-search queries.
1. An **inverted index** - the inverted index allows for filtering by properties, as well as serve BM25 queries.

One of Weaviate's core strengths is combining the ANN index with an inverted index.

Some things to bear in mind:

* Especially for large datasets, configuring the indices is important because the more you index, the more storage is needed.
* A rule of thumb -- if you don't query over a specific field or vector space, don't index it.
* One of Weaviate's unique features is how the indices are regulated (learn more about this [here](../concepts/prefiltering.md)).

### ANN indexing

What's important to know, is that the "A" in ANN (i.e., the "approximate") comes with a trade-off. That is, the index is _approximate_ and, therefore _not_ always 100% accurate. This is what the experts mean when they talk about the "recall of the algorithm."

:::tip
There are different ANN algorithms, you can find a nice overview of them on <a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/" data-proofer-ignore>this website</a>. Only those algorithms which support [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) can be used in Weaviate (we want that sweet database UX) and Weaviate's ANN system is [completely plug-and-playable](../concepts/index.md#weaviates-architecture-from-above) so that we can always add other algorithms in the future.

<!-- TODO: Not sure if we need this here -->
<!-- If you always want total recall (i.e., a 100% recall, not to be confused with the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie), you need brute-force vector comparisons that are super slow (as in, _really_ slow) and not useful for production settings (hence ANN algorithms exist). -->

:::note
Because vector search use cases are growing rapidly, more and more ANN-algorithm are produced. A "good" ANN algorithm means that the recall is high _and_ that it's fast. You can dive into the rabbit hole right [here](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=approximate+nearest+neighbor&searchtype=all). But! Don't be like Alice; just make sure to come back here.

Let's take a look a few ANN settings in an example schema.

_(note that we've removed some JSON that's irrelevant to the topic at hand)._

```js
{
    "classes": [
        {
            "class": "Publication",
            "properties": [],
            "vectorIndexType": "hnsw" // <== the current ANN algorithm 
            "vectorIndexConfig": { // <== the vector index settings
                "skip": false,
                "cleanupIntervalSeconds": 300,
                "maxConnections": 64,
                "efConstruction": 128,
                "ef": -1,
                "dynamicEfMin": 100,
                "dynamicEfMax": 500,
                "dynamicEfFactor": 8,
                "vectorCacheMaxObjects": 2000000,
                "flatSearchCutoff": 40000,
                "distance": "cosine"
            }
        },
        { } // <== the Author class
    ]
}
```

As shown above, there are quite a few configurable parameters available for an ANN index. Modifying them can affect Weaviate's performance, such as tradeoffs between the recall performance and query time, or between query time and import time. 

Read more below on:
- [Configuring the vector index](../configuration/vector-index-type.md)
- [Explanation of vector indices](../concepts/vector-index-plugins.md)

:::note
The [ANN benchmark page](/docs/weaviate/benchmarks/ann.md) contains a wide variety of vector search use cases and relative benchmarks. This page is ideal for finding a dataset similar to yours and learning what the most optimal settings are.

### Configure the inverted index

In contrast to the ANN index, there are very few configurable parameters for an inverted index. It's on or it's off and indexes on a property level.

The inverted index is by default _on_. You can simply turn it of like this:

```js
{
    "class": "Author",
    "properties": [ // <== note that the inverted index is set per property
        {
            "indexInverted": false, // <== turn it off by setting `indexInverted` to false
            "dataType": [
                "string"
            ],
            "name": "name"
        }
    ]
}
```

A rule of thumb to follow when determining if you turn it on or off is this: _if you don't need it to query, turn it off._

:::note
We support both `string` and `text` data types, they play a role in tokenization in the inverted index, more information can be found [here](/docs/weaviate/configuration/datatypes.md#datatype-string-vs-text).
:::

You can also enable an inverted index to search [based on timestamps](/docs/weaviate/configuration/schema-configuration.md#invertedindexconfig--indextimestamps).

```js
{
    "class": "Author",
    "invertedIndexConfig": {
        "indexTimestamps": true // <== false by default
    },
    "properties": []
}
```

### Classes without indices

If you don't want to set an index at all, neither ANN nor inverted, this is possible too.

If we don't want to index the `Authors` we can simply skip all indices (vector _and_ inverted) like this:

```js
{
    "class": "Author",
    "description": "A description of this class, in this case, it's about authors",
    "vectorIndexConfig": {
        "skip": true // <== disable vector index
    },
    "properties": [
        {
            "indexInverted": false, // <== disable inverted index for this property
            "dataType": [
                "string"
            ],
            "description": "The name of the Author",
            "name": "name"
        },
        {
            "indexInverted": false, // <== disable inverted index for this property
            "dataType": [
                "int"
            ],
            "description": "The age of the Author",
            "name": "age"
        },
        {
            "indexInverted": false, // <== disable inverted index for this property
            "dataType": [
                "date"
            ],
            "description": "The date of birth of the Author",
            "name": "born"
        },
        {
            "indexInverted": false, // <== disable inverted index for this property
            "dataType": [
                "boolean"
            ],
            "description": "A boolean value if the Author won a nobel prize",
            "name": "wonNobelPrize"
        },
        {
            "indexInverted": false, // <== disable inverted index for this property
            "dataType": [
                "text"
            ],
            "description": "A description of the author",
            "name": "description"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Module configuration
<!-- TODO: Check whether this can be removed. Feels duplicated. -->

You can use Weaviate with or without modules. To use Weaviate _with_ modules, you must configure them in the schema.

An example configuration:

```js
{
    "class": "Author",
    "moduleConfig": { // <== module config on class level
        "text2vec-transformers": { // <== the name of the module (in this case `text2vec-transformers`)
            // the settings based on the choosed modules
        }
    },
    "properties": [ ]
}
```

When using vectorizers, you need to set vectorization on the class and property level. In the case you use text vectorizers, the way the vectorizers work is explained [here](/docs/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-contextionary.md#regulate-semantic-indexing).

```js
{
    "class": "Author",
    "moduleConfig": { // <== class level configuration 
        "text2vec-transformers": { // <== name of the module
            "vectorizeClassName": false // <== vectorize the class name?
        }
    },
    "properties": [{
        "moduleConfig": { // <== property level configuration
            "text2vec-transformers": { // <== name of the module
                "skip": false, // <== skip this `string` for vectorization?
                "vectorizePropertyName": false // <== vectorize the property name?
            }
        },
        "dataType": [
            "string"
        ],
        "name": "name"
    }]
}
```

:::note
Because Weaviate's vectorizer module configuration is set on class and property level, you can have multiple vectorizers for different classes. You can even mix multimodal, NLP, and image modules.

## Recap

* The ANN index needs to be set for your use case (especially if you have a large dataset)
* You can enable or disable the index based on your use case
* You can configure Weaviate modules in the schema
