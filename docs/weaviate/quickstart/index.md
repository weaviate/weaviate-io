## Overview

Welcome to the Weaviate **Quickstart tutorial**.

This tutorial is designed to quickly teach you how to use Weaviate, from spinning up an instance to performing queries.

In this guide, we will show you how to:
- Spin up an instance of Weaviate
- Set up a database schema
- Import data to populate the database, and
- Perform queries to retrieve relevant data 

By the end of the guide, you will end up with a simple, but fully functioning vector database. You will also have performed vector searches to retrieve information from that database.

Have fun working with Weaviate, and please do let us know when you have questions or if you have a cool use case to share!

## Before you start 

In the guide, we make a few basic assumptions (you are somewhat familiar with databases, know what vector embeddings are, and can read essential JSON and GraphQL).
