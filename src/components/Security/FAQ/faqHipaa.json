    "question": "What Is HIPAA and Why It Matters?",
    "answer": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a U.S. federal law enacted in 1996 to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals\u2019 medical information. Over the past three decades, HIPAA has become the gold standard for handling Protected Health Information (PHI or ePHI), covering everything from diagnoses and treatment histories to prescription records and billing details. Any organization that creates, receives, or stores PHI must adhere to HIPAA\u2019s stringent requirements."

  {
    "question": "Core Principles of HIPAA",
    "answer": "<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Only authorized individuals and systems may access PHI. Role-based access controls and strict authentication protocols ensure that sensitive data remains visible only to those who truly need it.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> PHI must remain accurate and unaltered, unless modified through authorized workflows. Integrity controls\u2014such as write-once, immutable backups\u2014prevent unauthorized tampering or data corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Patients and caregivers depend on timely access to their information. Systems must be designed with redundancy and disaster-recovery plans to guarantee that PHI is accessible whenever it\u2019s needed, even in the event of hardware failures or outages.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum-Necessary Use:</strong> Organizations should limit their collection, use, and disclosure of PHI to the minimum required for a given task. This \u201cleast privilege\u201d approach minimizes risk by ensuring that no one\u2014even within a covered entity\u2014sees more data than they need to perform their job.</p>"

  {
    "question": "Who Must Comply?",
    "answer": "<p>HIPAA breaks these stakeholders into three main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Covered Entities</strong> \u2013 Health plans (e.g., insurers and health maintenance organizations (HMOs)), health care providers (e.g., hospitals, clinics, laboratories), and health care clearinghouses that handle PHI directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Business Associates</strong> \u2013 Third-party vendors, consultants, and service providers\u2014like Weaviate\u2014who receive, transmit, or process PHI on behalf of covered entities. Business associates must sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and are held to the same HIPAA standards as covered entities themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Subcontractors & Sub-processors</strong> \u2013 Any downstream partners who handle PHI on behalf of a Business Associate\u2014cloud providers, analytics tools, even mailing houses\u2014are themselves treated as Business Associates under HIPAA. That means you need a chain of signed BAAs all the way down, and full visibility into how each service processes and protects PHI.</li>\n</ul>"

  {
    "question": "What Counts as PHI (and What Doesn\u2019t)?",
    "answer": "<p>Under HIPAA, any personal data used for medical purposes or drawn from a medical record qualifies as PHI. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name, address</li>\n<li>Phone, fax, email, web URLs or IP addresses</li>\n<li>Account, Social Security, medical, or patient identification numbers</li>\n<li>Vehicle identifiers (e.g., license plate, VIN)</li>\n<li>Biometric data (fingerprints, facial photographs)</li>\n<li>Geographic information</li>\n<li>Any other characteristics that could identify an individual</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because PHI is essentially any information that can identify\u2014or be used to re-identify\u2014a person, it\u2019s best to treat all data as if it could be PHI. That means we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Access only when authorized,</strong> such as troubleshooting a live incident</li>\n<li><strong>Never copy, move, or transfer</strong> data outside of its approved storage location</li>\n<li><strong>Always respect security controls</strong>, do not attempt to bypass network\u2010access restrictions or encryption policies</li>\n<li><strong>Obtain customer authorization</strong> before making any data changes (for example, restoring a backup at their request)</li>\n</ul>"

  {
    "question": "Are Vector Embeddings PHI?",
    "answer": "On their own, vector embeddings are simply numerical representations of input data\u2014not PHI. However, if embeddings can be linked back to identifiable information or used with other data to reconstruct patient records, they must be protected under the same controls as the original unstructured data. Look out for a blog post on this topic soon!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Enforcement & Penalties",
    "answer": "HIPAA isn\u2019t just guidance\u2014it carries real teeth. Civil penalties range up to $50,000 per violation (with an annual cap of $1.5 million), and willful neglect can lead to criminal charges (fines up to $250,000 and even prison time). Highlighting the risk of non-compliance underscores why we\u2014and our partners\u2014must treat every PHI workflow with utmost care."
