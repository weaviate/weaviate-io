            <h2>The AI Application Platform for Unstructured Data</h2>
            <p>
              Instabase is an enterprise-grade AI Application Platform that
              turns unstructured data into insights, instantly. They solve one
              of the most acute problems businesses face – slow or inaccurate
              decisioning due to unstructured data. Their engineering team was
              looking for a database that would allow them to deliver data
              insights to their users with a high degree of accuracy and rapid
              performance. They chose Weaviate because of the flexibility that a
              leading open-source tool gave them while hitting Instabase’s
              critical performance metrics better than any other database they
              tested. Built-in features like hybrid search and distance metrics,
              as well as support from an engaged developer community, made
              Weaviate the clear choice for Instabase.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              Instabase processes over 500K highly varied documents per day and
              needs to scale to the ever-growing demand of their customers. They
              needed a database solution that would allow them to index, store,
              and retrieve massive volumes of data while delivering results with
              an incredibly high level of accuracy to their users. “Accuracy
              determines the amount of savings any large institution can get,”
              said Shaunak Godbole, Head of Infrastructure Engineering at
              Instabase. “If the results aren’t accurate or take too long to
              surface, a human needs to get involved, and the cost savings goes
              away. So accuracy and speed are critical for us.”  Additionally,
              Instabase needed to support customers in highly regulated
              environments. European customers needed to ensure their data
              didn’t leave certain countries, while financial institutions
              didn’t want their data to leave their on-premises servers. They
              needed a database solution that could be deployed anywhere while
              maintaining a high level of performance. If accuracy, speed, and
              flexible deployment criteria were not met, Instabase would not be
              able to reduce the need for human intervention in complex data
              workflows for their customers.

            <h2>Why Instabase Chose Weaviate</h2>
            <p>
              Instabase wants to empower their customers to focus on making fast
              and accurate decisions. They achieve this by classifying,
              extracting, and validating information from highly unstructured
              data. “The collaboration with Weaviate’s team, the community, and
              the results of our performance tests made Weaviate an easy
              choice,” notes Godbole. “In terms of performance, nobody needed
              convincing – the benchmarks spoke for themselves.”
            </p>
            <p>Weaviate checked all of Instabase’s boxes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Powerful performance:</strong> Instabase had their own
                benchmarks for the use cases they knew they had to solve really,
                really well. These benchmarks focus on retrieval accuracy and
                latency, and the queries are complex aggregation and composition
                where both dense and sparse searches are required. Each use case
                had different benchmarks, and Weaviate was a clear winner with
                high retrieval accuracy and low latency for vector search. Once
                the benchmarking team was convinced Weaviate was up for the
                challenge, teams across the organization worked together to
                bring Weaviate into production.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>High adaptability:</strong> By using an AI-native
                open-source vector database, Instabase could meet their
                customers wherever they operated, whether in the cloud or
                on-prem. This allowed for maximum flexibility to fulfill the
                strict deployment needs of organizations in highly regulated
                regions and industries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Modular architecture:</strong> Instead of having to
                build out their own capabilities, Instabase developers saved
                time by using Weaviate’s out of the box features like hybrid
                search and distance metrics, as well as easy integrations with
                popular large language models (LLMs).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strong support:</strong> Weaviate has cultivated an
                engaged, open source community with over 6M downloads and tens
                of thousands of organizations using the platform. Over 5K
                developers have direct access to the experts and comprehensive
                documentation they need to quickly problem solve as they build
                their applications. In addition, Weaviate’s core team was very
                collaborative with Instabase and was able to provide short,
                medium and long-term solutions to existing and anticipated
                challenges.

              In 2017, the engineers at Instabase made the choice to build
              entirely on Kubernetes. They have several microservices that run
              on top of that and are deeply integrated with the{' '}
