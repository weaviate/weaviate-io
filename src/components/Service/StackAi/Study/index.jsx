            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Stack AI chose Weaviate as the vector database to power their
                enterprise AI orchestration platform. This resulted in
                significant cost savings, enhanced customer retention, and the
                ability to serve security-conscious customers through flexible
                deployment capabilities.

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, Stack AI faces intense
              pressure to integrate new features and capabilities at
              unprecedented speed. Their enterprise customers require quick
              access to the latest AI models, embeddings, external applications,
              and advanced querying capabilities. The challenge lies in
              delivering these features rapidly while maintaining performance
              and reliability.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                {' '}
                "Business is moving at the speed of light. If you don't add
                features as soon as possible, competitors will add them,"
              </strong>{' '}
              explains Antoni Rosinol,<br></br> CEO and Co-founder of Stack AI.
            </p>{' '}
            <p>
              As the Stack AI team evaluated which datastore they would use,
              several key requirements came up. They wanted a reliable and
              fully-featured vector database, not a solution that had vector
              search bolted on like MongoDB or Postgres with pgvector.
            </p>{' '}
            <p>
              This also meant that they required top-tier performance and
              accuracy in vector search while maintaining reasonable costs for
              their growing company. Finally, they needed to be able to support
              large organizations that had strict legal and compliance
              requirements, so the ability to deploy in a secure environment was
              a must.

            <h2>Why Weaviate?</h2>
            <p>
