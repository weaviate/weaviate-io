    "question": "What do you mean by 1 million vector dimensions?",
    "answer": "In Weaviate, you can attach a vector embedding to a data object. A vector embedding can have an x-amount of dimensions. To calculate vector dimensions, multiply the number of data objects by the number of embedding dimensions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do you price per vector dimension?",
    "answer": "Some vectors have a lot of embeddings (sometimes more than 10k), some just a few (e.g., 90). The more vector dimensions you store, the more infrastructure is needed to optimize and maintain performance, this is the reason why we calculate with individual dimensions. We believe it's the fairest and most accurate price to give you the best experience."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the Weaviate pricing formula?",
    "answer": "You pay for the total amount of embedding dimensions stored per data object and per data object queried. For example, if you have a 100-dimensional embedding and you store 1k documents that you query 1k times per month. You pay for 200k dimensions.",
    "code": "<code>(stored objects + objects queried) * embedding dimension size * SLA tier price per dimension</code>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a difference between Weaviate open source and the Weaviate version used by the WCS?",
    "answer": "No, the Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) is a different solution using the same code as Weaviate open-source. The difference is the WCS itself (i.e., SaaS) and different SLA types (opposed to the open-source BSD3 license)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a discount for non-profits, startups, or students?",
    "answer": "​Yes, please reach out to us at <a href='mailto:hello+discount@weaviate.io'>hello+discount@weaviate.io</a>"
  },
  {
    "question": "​Is the Weaviate Cloud Service SOC2 compliment?",
    "answer": "Not yet; we are currently in the process of becoming SOC2 compliant. Feel free to email us for a status update on <a href='mailto:hello+soc2@weaviate.io'>hello+soc2@weaviate.io</a>"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Hibernation?",
    "answer": "​Hibernation ​is a process where a cluster goes down (i.e., 'hybernates') while retaining your data after a given period. This is ideal for research or development purposes; when the service endpoints are used again, the service comes back up with a short time delay."
  },
  {
    "question": "​What is round-robin provisioning?",
    "answer": "​If your SLA tier contains round-robin provisioning, the Weaviate Cloud Service will provision on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ​or Microsoft Azure where enough resources are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I pay for data objects without embeddings?",
    "answer": "​No, storage of data objects without vector embeddings is on us.​"
  },
  {
    "question": "​W​hich Weaviate modules​ are available?​",
    "answer": "Weaviate modules based on inference APIs are automatically integrated in the cloud service. These modules currently include Hugging Face Inference and OpenAI's embeddings end-points.​"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I store data from different models with different embedding sizes?",
    "answer": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "question": "​My use case fluctuates in the number of data objects stored per month, how do you calculate the total number of objects per month?",
    "answer": "​We take the median number of vectors per month measured per hour."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I have an unexpected ​usage spike?",
    "answer": "Usage spikes are -almost- always a good sign! Your Weaviate-powered app or platform is being actively used, and we don't want your bill to be in the way of your success. Spikes are analyzed at the end of the month, and occasional ones are on us.​"
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is behind Weaviate?​",
    "answer": "​The company behind Weaviate is <a href='https://semi.technology' target='_blank'>SeMI Technologies</a>. They run the Cloud Service and maintain the open source software.​"
