    "question": "What's an AIU?",
    "answer": "An AI Unit (AIU) is a Weaviate-specific unit that can be applied to hot, warm, and cold storage tiers and compute costs. AIUs enable customers to better monitor usage and improve budgeting. For more information on AIUs and Enterprise Cloud pricing, <a href=\"http://events.weaviate.io/pricing-download\" target=\"_blank\">read more here</a>."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I use AIUs for?",
    "answer": "AIUs are currently only applicable to Weaviate Enterprise Cloud. In the future, we will introduce AIU pricing to Weaviate Serverless Cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will Weaviate Serverless Support AIUs?",
    "answer": "AIUs are currently only applicable to Weaviate Enterprise Cloud. In the future, we will introduce AIU pricing to Weaviate Serverless Cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I move tenants to different storage tiers?",
    "answer": "Currently, the ability to move tenants between hot, warm, and cold storage is only available if you are using Weaviate Enterprise Cloud or self-hosting Weaviate. In the near future, we will make this functionality available in Weaviate Serverless Cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'dimension' in this context?",
    "answer": "A vector 'dimension' refers to one element in a vector representing an object in a vector database. The total number of these elements is the vector's dimensionality."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the pricing based on the total number of dimensions?",
    "answer": "The total count of vector dimensions is a good indicator of the resources required. Therefore we adopt is as a fair way to balance actual resource usage with costs incurred."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I determine the total number of dimensions?",
    "answer": "The total number of dimensions can be determined by multiplying the object count (of those with vectors) with the vector dimensionality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the differences between 'Performance' and 'Compression' storage types?",
    "answer": "This sets whether to use vector compression, using a technique called product quantization. Enabling compression will effectively reduce dimensionality and therefore prices. However, it may reduce performance & recall. <a href=\"https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#hnsw-with-product-quantization-pq\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a>."
  },
  {
    "question": "When Compression is selected, how are the total number of dimensions determined?",
    "answer": "When a Compression storage type is used, we take the the total number of 'segments' in place of the number of dimensions. <a href=\"https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#segments\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a>."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the open source Weaviate the same as that used on Weaviate Cloud?",
    "answer": "Yes! Weaviate Cloud (WCD) runs the open-source Weaviate library. The differences are in where it runs (i.e. Weaviate Cloud is managed by us as a SaaS) and in licensing (SLA tiers as opposed to the open-source BSD3 license)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are discounts available for non-profits, startups, or students?",
    "answer": "Yes, please reach out to us at <a href='mailto:hello+discount@weaviate.io'>hello+discount@weaviate.io</a>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Weaviate Cloud SOC2 compliant?",
    "answer": "Yes, for more info email <a href=\"mailto:infosec@weaviate.io\">infosec@weaviate.io</a>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I pay for data objects without embeddings?",
    "answer": "No, storage of data objects without vector embeddings is on us."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Weaviate modules are available?",
    "answer": "Weaviate modules based on inference APIs are automatically enabled in the cloud service."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Weaviate Cloud compatible with models of various embedding sizes?",
    "answer": "Yes."
