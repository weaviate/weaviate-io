// ✅ All @use statements must be at the TOP of the file, not nested
@use "form/index" as *;
@use "price" as *;
@use "priceReview" as *;
@use "row" as *;
@use "highAvailability" as *;
@use "form/select" as *;

// Now your CSS rules
.priceCalculator {
  // Your styles here - the @use imports above make everything available
}

// Note: The select dropdowns are outside the normal dom element tree so won't
// inherit styles from .priceCalculator
