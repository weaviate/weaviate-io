### **Exhibit A**

1. **Weaviate Enterprise Cloud Consumption**
   1. Generally. The Weaviate Enterprise Cloud service is provided to Customers as a service which consumes resources for distinct functions as set forth herein and is available in several different SLAs and hosted in different geographical regions by certain third-party cloud providers, as described more fully in your Order Form and the Documentation. Customer Data is uploaded into Customer’s cluster and may be stored in different storage tiers).
   2. Burst Handling and Peak Consumption Management. In the Weaviate Enterprise Cloud, Customer may experience fluctuations in compute resource usage. To manage these fluctuations, Customer is permitted to increase their peak consumption by up to 50% over the baseline capacity without prior notice. This ensures flexibility in handling temporary spikes in demand. For any anticipated increases in peak consumption that exceed 50%, Customer must notify Weaviate and obtain approval at least one week in advance. This lead time is necessary to ensure that the required infrastructure can be provisioned to support the increased load without impacting service quality. Failure to provide adequate notice may result in the inability to accommodate the additional demand, or may incur additional charges.
   3. Infrastructure Overhead Charge. Operating the Weaviate Enterprise Cloud offering requires the setup and maintenance of dedicated compute resources, referred to as “Infrastructure Overhead.” This overhead is essential for managing and operating Customer clusters within a single-tenant architecture, ensuring that the cluster is always available, secure, and performing optimally. Due to the inherent costs associated with maintaining a single-tenant infrastructure, a minimum charge per hour will apply, irrespective of actual usage. This charge reflects the baseline compute resources required to keep Customer Weaviate cluster operational, even during periods of low activity.


2. **Weaviate AI Units**
   1. Storage and Compute. Weaviate bills for storage and compute using purchasable AI Units, as described herein (“Weaviate AIUs”). Virtual CPUs (“vCPU”) and different types of storage tiers (Hot, warm, and cold storage) use Weaviate AIUs at certain rates based on the effective size of the Customer cluster while in operation, as set forth in the Order Form. Unless otherwise noted, when a Customer cluster is started or resumed, a minimum of one hour worth of Weaivate AIUs will be consumed. In the event Weaviate uses storage and compute resources that are equivalently larger or smaller than the initial estimation, the AIU consumption rate will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if a Customer cluster uses storage and compute resources that go over estimated usage for 30 minutes, such use is measured as one storage- or compute-Hour. Storage and compute-Hours are calculated on a per hour basis, rounded up to the nearest whole hour. Weaviate-managed storage and compute is billed at the rate of the number of Weaviate AIUs per category as listed in the Order Form, multiplied by the applicable Customer AIU price. Storage and compute appears in the usage statement as a single line item per category.
   2. Additional Options. Weaviate offers a number of additional options (e.g., SSO and Private Link) as described in the Documentation. Additional options operate on the Customer cluster and are reflected in the Customer AIU price.
   3. Tools and Apps. Weaviate additionally offers tools and apps that run on Weaviate-managed compute resources (“Weaviate Tools and Apps”). Weaviate Tools and Apps are billed at the rates set forth in the Customer Order Form.
   4. AIU Pricing. The Weaviate Offering may be subscribed to on an On Demand basis, where usage is invoiced in arrears every month, or on a Fixed Term basis, where a set dollar amount of usage is purchased up front. Pricing depends on whether you are in On Demand or Capacity.


3. **Changes to Weaviate AIU pricing**
   1. The Weaviate AIUs required for storage and compute may be updated from time to time. Weaviate will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice via email or through the Weaviate Service of material changes, but the changes shall be effective on the date that Weaviate announces they are effective. If any change to the Weaviate AIU storage and compute materially increases the Weaviate AIUs required to use the Weaviate Service, you may terminate the applicable Order Form upon written notice to Weaviate and receive a refund of any prepaid and unused AIUs that you have purchased.
