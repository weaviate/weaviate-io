Weaviate shall categorize Support Tickets based on Customer’s characterization of the Severity Level. Customer will characterize the Severity Level based on the business impact of the incident or question to Customer using the Severity Levels described in the table above. If Weaviate disagrees with Customer’s characterization of the Severity Level, Weaviate will notify Customer and the parties will act in good faith to establish a Severity Level.

Weaviate shall provide an update on the investigation, resolution, or escalation of the Support Ticket within the response times set out in the table based on the Severity of the Support Ticket.


**Scope of Service Inquiries**

Support Requests: These are incidents or problems encountered in the operation of the current Weaviate Product, necessitating immediate attention to maintain or restore the expected service levels. Support Requests will be acknowledged and addressed promptly following the procedures outlined in Exhibit C: "Weaviate Service Level Agreement".


Service Requests: This term refers to inquiries from the Customer seeking additional services, new clusters, or modifications that extend beyond the existing scope of the Weaviate Product. Service Requests are categorized as non-urgent and project-based, requiring a separate assessment and planning process. The response and implementation timeline for these requests will be mutually determined, subject to resource availability, project complexity, and the terms set forth in the applicable Order Form.

### **Exhibit C**

**Weaviate Service Level Agreement**

**Introduction**

This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) delineates the service levels for Weaviate's vector database services, including the Standard, and Enterprise tiers, valid during the term of the Agreement. The infrastructure of the services is designed for Normal Use, and the Availability is applicable solely for Normal Use of the services. Any usage beyond Normal Use may lead to a degradation of service quality and availability. Issues accessing the service due to application errors (like misuse, misconfiguration, etc.) are excluded from Availability calculations and are not considered downtime, as these are the responsibility of the Customer.

**Normal Use**

Normal Use refers to the utilization of the service within the parameters outlined in our official documentation. The specifics of these parameters, including any limitations or restrictions, are detailed in the documentation available to all customers. In instances where a customer wishes to operate outside of these parameters, arrangements can be discussed and agreed upon in writing between the parties. For further details, please refer to our documentation.

**Definitions and Calculations**

Availability

Availability signifies that the services are functional and accessible to the Customer. The details for each parameter are as follows:

| Parameter               | Standard | Enterprise |
|-------------------------|----------|------------|
| Availability per Quarter| 99.5%    | 99.9%      |


Exclusions from the calculation of Availability include planned maintenance windows, maintenance requested by the Customer, and all downtime resulting from interruptions by third parties or other factors beyond Weaviate's control.

**Non-Availability**

Non-Availability refers to periods where the service level indicators are not consistently achieved, as defined below. The formal commencement of non-availability begins from the time the monitoring systems indicate such status or when the Customer notifies Weaviate at [support@weaviate.io](mailto:support@weaviate.io). This period concludes when Weaviate confirms the restoration of availability either through an email to the customer or an update on the relevant status page..

**Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**

The performance of the services is measured in regular intervals, with the service receiving a status of Non-Availability if the SLI tests fail to achieve the expected result in three consecutive tests.

Weaviate will use all information reasonably available to it in order to calculate the Affected Customer Ratio during unavailability. This includes, but is not limited to, Weaviate's analysis of service data immediately prior to the unavailability Period, in order to estimate the ratio of Customer’s visitors who were affected during an unavailability Period.

**SLI Tests**

| Test# | SLI Test       | How to test                                               | Expected Result                                    | Test interval        |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1      | Data Ingest    | A new object is added via API to a Weaviate schema       | A response of less than 1,000 ms with a HTTP status code of 200 | Every (3) minutes   |
| 2      | Data Query     | The Weaviate API is queried for an existing object       | A response of less than 1,000 ms with a HTTP status code of 200 | Every (3) minutes   |


**Reaction Time**

Upon becoming aware of a Non-Availability status, Weaviate will immediately address the issue and strive to initiate remediation efforts.

**Planned Maintenance Windows**

Planned maintenance windows are periods during which the availability of the services may be impacted due to scheduled maintenance activities. These windows are notified at least one week in advance to the Customer via email. Maintenance necessary to maintain operational safety due to unpredictable external circumstances may be carried out outside of these windows, with immediate notification to the Customer.

**Backup Policy**

Weaviate employs different backup policies for each tier:

- Standard Tier: Daily full backup, stored in the same region for 7 days
- Enterprise Tier: Daily full backup, stored in the another region for 30 days

**Monitoring**

Weaviate offers different monitoring solutions for each tier:

- Standard Tier: Public Status Page
- Enterprise Tier: Dedicated Status Page

**Service Credits**

In the event that the availability of the services as described herein is not met, Customer shall have the right to claim service credits according to the table below:

| Service Level Targets                  | Standard Tier | Enterprise Tier |
|---------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 99.9% or more                         | No service credits | No service credits |
| Less than 99.9% but more than 99.5%   | No service credits | 5% service credit |
| Less than 99.5% but more than 99%     | 5% service credit | 10% service credit |
| Less than 99% but more than 98.5%     | 10% service credit | 20% service credit |
| Less than 98.5% but more than 98%     | 20% service credit | 30% service credit |
| Below 98%                             | 30% service credit | 30% service credit |


Service credits are calculated as a percentage of the monthly fees paid by Customer and will be applied against future payments of fees due from Customer. To receive service credits, Customer must notify Weaviate by e-mail ([support@weaviate.io](mailto:support@weaviate.io)) within 30 days from the time the availability of the services was not met.
