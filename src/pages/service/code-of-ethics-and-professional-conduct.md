# Weaviate Hero - Code of ethics and professional conduct

### Be inclusive

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes but is not limited to, members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

<br></br>

### Be considerate


Inside our Community, we depend on each other to thrive, learn, share, and produce the best experience we can as a community. Your decisions and communication will impact other community members. You should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

<br></br>

### Be respectful

We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior. We all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration to become personal attacks. An environment where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive or creative one.

<br></br>

### Choose your words carefully

Always conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

<br></br>

### No room for harassment

In general, if someone asks you to stop something, then stop. When we disagree, try to understand why. Differences of opinion and disagreements are mostly unavoidable. What is important is that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

<br></br>

### Our differences can be our strengths​

We can find strength in diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.

<br></br>

### Lead with integrity

Weaviate’s Community stands for kindness, inclusiveness, respect, and integrity. These values should never be taken for granted. To maintain that experience inside our community, you need to adhere to this code of conduct at all times and exercise good judgment in your decisions and actions.

As a Weaviate Hero, you may face ethical and legal questions; some may be difficult ones. We should always consider these questions in ways that are consistent with Weaviate Community Values: 

<br></br>

 - Be Kind. 
 - Work together as one. 
 - Strive for excellence.
 - Encourage transparency. 
 - Inspire trust.

<br></br>

#### When in doubt, ask yourself a question 

Basic questions like the following will often help you eliminate any doubt about a decision or proposed action:

<br></br>

 - Is it honest?
 - Does it conform to the Code of Conduct?
 - Do I really feel comfortable with this decision?
 - What if this appeared in the news?
 - What if everyone were to behave like this?

Our Values in themselves may not provide obvious answers in all cases, but they should serve as the basis for the choices we make. Our Values also serve as the basis for the Code of Conduct, which provides greater guidance on the questions you may face.

<br></br>

### Be Compliant - at all times

Trust is a fragile gift, and we must never take it for granted. Compliance and integrity play an important role when building trustworthy relationships. Constantly challenge your own actions or words regarding compliance.

Weaviate’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations that apply to our business. If you have any questions about interpreting or applying these guidelines — or any other policies, directives, or guidelines — please contact and consult us immediately.

<br></br>

### Responsibilities and Enforcement

If a participant engages in negative or harmful behavior, Weaviate will take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to issuing warnings, expulsion from the program or event with no refund, deleting comments, permanent banning from future activities or online community, or calling local law enforcement. Weaviate has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, content, and other participants that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If you see a Code of Conduct violation:

<br></br>

1. If you feel comfortable, let the person know what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
2. If the person does not immediately stop the behavior, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, you can make a personal report by emailing the organizers, reporting to on-site security, or speaking with a designated staff member. Event organizers will provide reporting details specific to their venue.
3. If the code of conduct violation occurs at an event and requires immediate response or contains a concern about an individual attending an upcoming event, contact the event's on-call Code of Conduct point of contact listed in the event-specific code of conduct documentation. 
4. If You witness a Code of Conduct violation at any time, such as at events, in a Slack channel, or in open-source forums, it is your responsibility to report the violation.
