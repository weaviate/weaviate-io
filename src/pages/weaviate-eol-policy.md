### **End of Life Policy for Weaviate Offering**

**Last Updated: November, 2024**

---

### **Purpose**

We value the products we build, but sometimes we must retire older versions. This End of Life (EOL) policy outlines the process and timelines Weaviate follows when retiring Weaviate Offerings. The policy’s purpose is to ensure transparency, provide adequate notice to users, and facilitate a smooth transition to upgrades or alternative solutions.

---

### **Scope**

This policy applies to all versions of Weaviate Offerings and its related services, including software updates, technical support, and any third-party integrations that may be impacted by EOL.

---

### **End of Life Definition**

Weaviate’s version code is made of three numbers separated by dots: the leftmost number is the major release, the middle number is the minor release, and the rightmost number is the maintenance release (e.g., 1.26.7 means major release 1, minor release 26, and maintenance release 7).

“EOL” indicates that the Weaviate Offering will no longer be supported or maintained. Upon EOL:
- **End of Availability**: The Offering will no longer be available for purchase, download, or usage within Weaviate Cloud.
- **End of Support**: Weaviate has no obligation to provide back-ports, security patches, or other bug fixes to the Weaviate Offerings, nor provide any level of customer support.
- **End of Documentation**: Official Offering documentation will no longer be updated.

---

### **EOL Schedule and Timeline**

Our Offerings are released periodically, triggering the following EOL schedule:

- **Major releases** will be supported for up to 12 months after a new major version is released. For example, when major version 2 is released, version 1 will remain supported for up to 12 months from the release date of version 2.
- **Minor releases** will be supported up to 3 minor versions back from the current minor version. For instance, if 1.27 is the current version, prior versions up to 1.24 are also supported, while versions prior to 1.24 are not in scope for support.

---

### **Customer Options and Transition Support**

To assist with the transition, Weaviate offers:
- **Upgrade Path**: Recommendations for migrating to the latest version or alternative Offering within the Weaviate portfolio.
- **Upgrade Assistance**: Resources, tools, and services, where applicable, to help customers plan and transition to later versions.

---

### **Extended Support**

For customers needing additional time, Weaviate may offer extended support on a paid basis, subject to the following:

- **Duration**: Up to 24 months beyond the official EOL date.
- **Scope**: Only critical security patches or minimal technical support will be provided.
- **Cost**: Contact Weaviate sales for pricing information.

---

### **Responsibilities**

- **Customer Responsibility**: Customers are responsible for planning their transition to an alternative or updated solution before the EOL date to avoid service disruptions or security risks.
- **Company Responsibility**: Weaviate will provide timely communication and reasonable support to assist customers throughout the transition period.

---

### **Exceptions**

Exceptions to this policy may be made on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by Weaviate. Any approved exceptions will be communicated individually to affected customers.

---

### **Limitation of Liability**

After the EOL date, Weaviate is not liable for any security issues, bugs, or disruptions experienced by customers who continue using the Weaviate offerings.

---

### **Policy Updates**

This EOL policy may be reviewed and updated periodically, with updates published on the Weaviate website and indicated within the policy.

---
