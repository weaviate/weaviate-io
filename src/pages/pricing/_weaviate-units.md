## **Weaviate Units (WUs)**

Weaviate Units (WUs) are the standard pricing unit for usage across all Weaviate products and services.  

Each Weaviate Unit represents **$1 USD in value**.

<br></br>

### **How WUs Are Used**

WUs provide a consistent and unified way to measure and bill usage across Weaviate’s ecosystem:

- **Weaviate Cloud** – costs associated with Shared and Dedicated clusters  
- **Embedding Service** – generating text, image, or multimodal embeddings  
- **Query Agent** – executing Ask and Search queries  
- **Education** – access to Weaviate Academy and training resources  
- **Future features** – additional Weaviate services as they are introduced  

<br></br>

### **WUs in Monthly (Pay-as-You-Go) Plans**

For monthly plans, usage is:

- Billed **in arrears each month**
- Shown in invoices as both **Weaviate Units** and **USD equivalent**
- Paid using the billing method associated with the organization

<br></br>

### **WUs in Prepaid Plans**

For prepaid plans, organizations purchase WUs upfront as credits. These credits are then used across eligible Weaviate products throughout the contract term.

#### **Key Terms**

- WUs measure **usage value**, not purchase price  
- Contracted discounts may reduce the cost of WUs  
- WU credits have **start and expiry dates** defined in the contract  
- Additional WUs can be purchased at contracted rates  
- Credits are **non-refundable and non-transferable**  
- Expired or unused credits follow contract rollover/expiry rules  

<br></br>

### **Viewing Available Credits**

Organizations on prepaid plans can view purchased, used, and remaining WUs in:  
**Console → Organization → Billing**

## **Consumption of Prepaid Weaviate Units**

### **1. Credit Purchase**

- Credits are purchased (often at a discounted rate)  
- Valid for **at least one year**, unless otherwise defined  
- Discounts and eligible deployment types are determined by the contract  

### **2. Usage and Deduction**

- As clusters run or queries execute, WU usage is tracked  
- Monthly deductions occur automatically from credit balances  

### **3. Overage**

If prepaid credits run out before expiration:

- Additional usage is billed at **on-demand (list) prices**  
- An overage invoice is generated for that billing cycle  

### **4. Top-Ups**

- Additional WU credits can be purchased anytime  
- New credits typically inherit the **same expiry date** as the original contract unless otherwise negotiated  

### **5. Contract End**

- Any unused credits expire at the end of the contract period  
- Rollover applies only if specifically included in the agreement  

### **6. Non-payment or Delays**

- Missing or invalid payment methods may result in **temporary suspension** of Weaviate products and services
