### **PRIVACY POLICY OF WEAVIATE B.V.**

This is the privacy policy of Weaviate B.V. (“**Weaviate**”, “**we**”, and “**our**”). Weaviate is a private limited company, established at the Prinsengracht 769A in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Weaviate is responsible for the collection and use of your personal data as described in this privacy policy. 

<br></br>

### **1. What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?**

<br></br>

At Weaviate we respect your privacy and seek to protect the personal data we collect and use in accordance with applicable personal data protection legislation. Therefore, this privacy policy serves to clarify what personal data we collect, use, share, store and otherwise process in various situations, and how, why and on what legal basis we do so. 

What is relevant to you depends on your relationship with us. Therefore, this privacy policy is structured in a layered way to allow you to read only what is relevant to you. Therefore, please refer to:
 
<br></br>

**Section 2, if you make use of our Weaviate products and services;**

<br></br>

**Section 3, if you visit our websites or complete forms on our websites;**

<br></br>

**Section 4, if you contact us;**

<br></br>

**Section 5, if you subscribe to or receive our newsletter.**

<br></br>

The subsequent sections address general matters. More specifically, **Section** **6** clarifies what (third) parties may have access to or may receive your personal data. Furthermore, **Section 7** informs you about the measures we have taken to protect your personal data and the period during which we store your personal data. In **Section 8** you can read what rights you have in relation to your personal data and how you may exercise these rights. Finally, in **Section 9**, you can find our contact details in case you have any questions, remarks, or complaints regarding the processing of your personal data by us.

<br></br>

This privacy policy was most recently amended in** February 2024 **and this version replaces earlier versions. We may need to amend this privacy policy from time to time. The most recent version of this privacy policy is available on our [website](/service). In case of important changes, we will actively inform you on these changes. 

<br></br>

### ** 2. If you make use of Weaviate products and services**

<br></br>

Weaviate is an open-source vector database that permits you to store data objects and vector embeddings. You may use our Weaviate vector database in different manners. You may use our open-source vector database technology yourself by deploying it within your own self-managed environment. You may also simplify your cloud management with our cloud solution called Weaviate Cloud, which we offer serverless (referred to as our “**Serverless service**”) or inside your customer managed VPC (referred to as our “**BYOC service**”).

<br></br>

What personal data Weaviate collects and uses depends on what product or service you use and how you use it, as further detailed below. Generally, Weaviate will offer its products and services to companies, rather than individuals. In such cases, we may still collect and use personal data, for instance of representatives or personnel of those companies or other users of our products and services. 

<br></br>

You may provide us with personal data relating to another individual than yourself, for example a colleague or a representative of the company you are working for. If this is the case, please provide the relevant individual with a copy of this privacy policy before providing us with this individual’s personal data.

<br></br>

a. If you **download or use our open-source database**, or if you **use our Weaviate vector database via GCP or AWS marketplace**, we do not process your personal data.

<br></br>

b. If you make **use of our Serverless service**, we process the following personal data, for the following purposes and on the following legal basis:

<br></br>

### **6. What parties have access to your personal data?**

<br></br>

We may disclose your personal data or make your personal data available to third parties for the purposes mentioned above. This disclosure includes the following third parties for the following purposes:

These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area. The regulations in these countries do not always provide the same level of protection of personal data as the regulations in the Netherlands. Where required, Weaviate takes appropriate measures to comply with the requirements that the applicable privacy regulations impose on the international transfer of personal data.

<br></br>

We may, for instance, conclude so-called European Model Agreements for the transfer of personal data with our service providers. We may also supply personal data to recipients established in the US if they have a valid EU-US Data Privacy Framework certification. 

<br></br>

<br></br>

We retain your personal data for a period of 5 years or as long as required to realize the objectives as described in this privacy policy. If we no longer require personal data, then we delete this personal data or anonymize it in order that they can no longer be linked to you.

<br></br>

**a. The right to access:** you may ask us whether or not we process any of your personal data and, if so, receive a copy of such personal data. When complying with an access request, we will also provide you with additional information, such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned as well as any other information necessary for you to exercise the essence of this right; 

<br></br>

**b. The right to rectification:** you have the right to have your data rectified in case of inaccuracy or incompleteness. Upon request, we will correct inaccurate personal data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, complete incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement; 

<br></br>

**c. The right to erasure**: you also have the right to have your personal data erased, which means the deletion of your data by us and, where relevant, any other controller to whom we have disclosed your data. Erasure of your personal data only finds place in certain cases, prescribed by law, and listed under article 17 of the GDPR. This includes situations where your personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the initial purposes for which they were processed as well as situations where they were processed unlawfully;

<br></br>

**d. The right to restriction of processing:** you have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data, which means that we suspend the processing of your data for a certain period of time. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data was contested but some time is needed for us to verify their (in)accuracy. This right does not prevent us from continuing to store your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted;

<br></br>

**e. The right to data portability:** under certain circumstances, you may request us to provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to have such data transmitted directly to another controller, where technically feasible. Upon request and where this is technically feasible, we will transmit your personal data directly to the other controller; and

**f. The right to object:** you also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, which means you may request us to no longer process your personal data. This only applies in case the ‘legitimate interests’ ground (including profiling) constitutes the legal basis for processing (which is indicated above. 

<br></br>

Please note that we may require you to provide additional information to verify your identity before responding to your request. Furthermore, there may be situations where we are lawfully entitled to deny or restrict your rights described in this Section. In any case, we will carefully assess whether such an exemption applies and inform you accordingly. We may, for example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other individuals or refuse to delete your personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for compliance with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply in case the personal data was not provided by you or if we process the data not on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract.
